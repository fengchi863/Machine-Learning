"It happens with PCs too. There were major changes between XP and Vista (for example) that meant that many existing applications and drivers were no longer compatible. This has also been true, to a lesser extent, between other versions of Windows.

On Mac OS X, it's also not uncommon for apps to stop working after upgrading. This was particularly true when Apple dropped support for their Rosetta compatibility layer that helped older PowerPC software run on modern intel Macs.

The other difference is that, in the case of carriers, sometimes the modifications they make to the phone handsets alter the operating system itself (e.g. involve custom user interface and theme elements) that are much more likely to break when the Operating System is updated (as compared to a standalone app, for example).

Carriers also care a lot about their users' experience and they don't want any updates causing problems or breaking compatibility with their apps or custom modifications because it looks bad on them and customers will all start complaining to them that stuff isn't working anymore.

"Figured I'd repost so you could see.Man, I used to say that I am sorry. Now I've realized an officer/trooper/Sherriff is a civilian with a better than average understanding of the law, trained in a week long fairly decent self defense class, and has taken a one week handgun and taser combo course. This person is supposed to enforce the law and is the first line of defense or rescue of those in trouble. I do not break the law, I am not some criminal or ass hole. What I am is a fairly well trained and practiced shooter (months of shooting/range time) and a combat veteran of the Kunar Province of Afghanistan (time in the Korengal Valley, lived at the mouth of it on the Pakistan side for damn months). I dislike police because they do not take their work seriously or professionally. When police fuck up and kill children or hurt people its out of lack of training. Usually out of fear and unfamiliarity of high stress. Some tragedies are unavoidable. They have volunteered to take it upon themselves to defend the defenseless and not train until proficient in the requirements of their job. That is either over confidence, apathy, and/or laziness. Also disregard for human life and the respect of your common man. I don't fucking like anyone with any any of those qualities. Be the example, I will answer honestly and help any officer either way, but I will be able to tell if you're tactically proficient within seconds of our encounter, I'll actually respect that you then.If are fat it doesn't matter either way, no respect.Nothing on those who aren't gun enthusiast or shooters - just don't put yourself in a position that possibly end in loss of life.Have a good day :)And on a personal note, one can remain any level of professionalism and still maintain kind, courteous, and respectful.

Don't forget that the stats get more stats when you get more %. So at 100% the 56 str would be 112 str (56 str + 56 str). Meaningwise you need 2800 base strength without multipliers.

"So I like the album....but it really doesn't feel like a Dre album to me. The G-funk sound is just not really there for the most part. And a lot of the hooks are kinda forgettable.

The verses from almost everybody are solid. Em, Kendrick, and Jon Connor killed it. Even Snoop was rapping better than I've heard from him in years. And the beats were top notch.

But a lot of this album sounds kinda cluttered. There's just way too much going on in some of the songs.

And like others have said, Dre sounds very different. People are saying it's because he's older, but that can't be it. He was rapping on Kendrick's GKMC and sounded like classic Dre. He even had a guest verse on a song that came out last year and sounds the same as he always did. Yet on this album, something about his voice is different on nearly every song. It's gotta be intentional and I'm not sure I like it. I downloaded this album last night and legit deleted it after hearing the first song because I thought I had gotten some fucked up download with the pitch raised or something. I re-downloaded it this morning and realized, nope....that's just how Dre sounds now.

I like it, but I'm a little let down. After 2 classic albums and a 16 year wait for a new Dre album (even if it's not Detox), maybe my expectations were too high. I hate to be so critical because I DO really like it. It's a really good album by any other standards. But by Dr. Dre standards, it's probably the weakest he's ever done. I still want the scrapped Detox album.

"The scoping is just hierarchy + some syntactic sugar. Basically, when you see stuff like this:

    dependencies {
      //scope here
    }
    
The code inside the block implicitly calls to [DependencyHandler](https://docs.gradle.org/current/javadoc/org/gradle/api/artifacts/dsl/DependencyHandler.html). If the method isn't there, it delegates out to the outer scope instead (in this case, the Project object). In addition, there's dynamic syntactic sugar for some constructs (though IMO just using the API calls directly is more straightforward if slightly more verbose).

If you really just want to pull up the API methods inline in IntelliJ, you could do something like `DependencyHandler deps = dependencies)`.

&gt;What does suck though is that Groovy is largely built on the crappy Java collections API. I tried to print a Set and all it gave me was a pointer. Scala standard library ftw.

Really? If I run something like `println [1, 2, ,3] as Set` I get `[1, 2, 3]` printed as a result. I'm using Gradle 2.5 with Java 8, but I don't think it makes much difference.

On a related note - most containers in Gradle are based on Gradle's DomainObject collections (admittedly, those are based on the Groovy collections). They have a number of convenient methods for making your builds more declarative and thus easier to reason about that you should probably check out (e.g. withType, all, matching, etc).

&gt;edit: I just discovered the Zeal documentation viewer, perhaps that is also what you are using? There is an unofficial work-in-progress Gradle docset here.

I actually hadn't heard of Zeal - mine is pretty simple: the offline html api docs is an all-in-one page with frames, so a simple text search usually jumps to whatever I was looking for.

To be honest though, if I'm doing anything actually complex with Gradle I prefer to wrap it in a plugin so it can be reused / standardized, and plugins use the same API as the buildscripts.

"I have two friends who have gone this.  Disclaimer before I start:-

1) 37/m/single, no kids.  Like you two, I wish.  Story time:- 

My friend Mary married an up and coming oil industry guy when she was 31.  Her mental biological clock was ticking for her already (as was reality), so they got down to it fast, and hit problems.  In the UK you're allowed 3 IVF rounds; first is free under the NHS, second two you pay for (at the time I gather it was something like £11k each time).  The limit is 3 rounds, for reasons I never got told nor deeply enquired into.  We are good friends, but on such a deeply personal matter friendship only goes so far.  I knew the problem was on her side, but no specifics.

Summing up the first two rounds, she had 3 miscarriages and an equal hell of a ride with hormonal drug treatments.  It was horrendous for them both; serious mood swings from one extreme to the other, weight swings for her all over the place, tiredness at times (couldn't get out of bed and had to phone in sick level tiredness), extreme hyperactivity at 3am at other times (had to go for 10 mile runs to get tired) and her husband had to deal with the lot.  She would launch world war 3 over the smallest details (forgot to get milk en route home type level) and knew she was being outrageous in her mood swings to her husband - therein lies a strong marriage that they can understand why and seek solace in the underneath foundations re why they got married in the first place.  I'll spare you the details of the miscarriages - one pregnancy lasted until 20 weeks - it made it worse with the hope it'll work.

Last bit of the final round, she gets pregnant again.  Final throw of the dice if you will.  This time the pregnancy holds.  She gets put on sick leave through a super protective doc about halfway through, she took maternity leave as soon as it was available by law and did total bed rest.  Zac got born, she was overjoyed, understandably.  Fast forward 5 months, pregnant again (naturally, with twins).  The twin bit isn't so normal, but the naturally pregnant again happens quite often after successful IVF apparently.  Maybe it's psychological and a bit of physiological things going on.

Then there's my ex-boss.  Similar situation.  They've been at it for 4-5 years.  We haven't discussed it for maybe 3 years.  I'm excellent friends with my ex-boss, but.  Still no joy.  Same thing, it's on her side, he checks out fine and they too have more than enough money to throw at it (not that that actually helps much).  They have nephews and nieces and godchildren, but it's obviously not the same thing.  They're coming to terms with the idea that maybe it's not meant to be.  He went through a seriously unhealthy stage for about 2 years - smoking like a chimney, consuming quite frankly incredible quantities of caffeine (8+ espressos a day level quantities), zero exercise, alcohol drinking 3/4 times weekly govt guidelines.  Now he's calmed down quite a lot (not totally) because he's recognised he's distancing his wife and the marriage is at stake and despite no children he won't give up on the marriage.

"I actually just started reading the Valiant stuff too and I'm at almost the exact same point. Currently working my way through this reading list:

So far, I've read X-O Manowar volumes 1-3, Harbinger volumes 1-2, and Bloodshot Volumes 1-2. It's felt a little uneven so far, but more good than bad.

**X-O Manowar** has been my favorite so far. I really dig the Superman + Conan vibe it has going, and Cary Nord's been killing it on the art.

**Harbinger** is pretty cool, but I don't think I've read enough yet to really grasp where this series is going.

**Bloodshot** has actually been my least favorite of the bunch so far. It's not *bad* exactly, but it feels very much like a generic action movie (with a sprinkle of Wolverine) to me. A couple of possible plot holes are bugging me as well ([Spoilers](#s ""If the nanites in his blood can take over computer systems and he's constantly getting shot up, shouldn't that affect the outcome of a LOT of action sequences where it's not addressed?"")), but maybe they'll be addressed later.

I realize I'm still really early in the overall Valiant arc though, so I haven't made up my mind about the stuff I'm less enthusiastic about.

"In all honesty, we're sort of fine with that. This thread is never going to be as useful as asking on a dedicated site such as Stackoverflow, and we don't want the sub to be used as an alternative to that. I've explained in many threads why that is, so I'm not going to repeat myself here. That said, I'll touch on a few points you two have raised:

&gt; It doesn't give enough attention to questions

We just removed all questions before, this was to be a middle ground option that kept the noise off the front page while giving an outlet for those who really feel like they have to post them on reddit.

&gt; it has effectively made the sub worse. 

The sub traffic stats since we made this change strongly disagree with you.

&gt; I don't know why this was done.

Explained below.

&gt; I know we'll never be rid of newbie questions, I don't know why that's a bad thing, but does it mean we have to become this intolerant

We are not being intolerant. We have rules set up to maintain some decent level of post quality, and we enforce them. That is not intolerance, this statement is a little melodramatic.

&gt; every day there are 5-10 questions

We actually remove probably ~10-15 posts per day and direct them here. Imagine if we leave those posts? Suddenly 75% of the front page is just people asking for help on their specific and self-serving problem. This is noise since they help almost no one but the OP, and since we've stopped allowing them, actual monthly sub viewership has gone up substantially. Even when they were answered, they would then just linger on the front page for the next 24 hours or so helping no one.

&gt; only one or two have answers

When these questions weren't funneled here, they remained largely unanswered in posts as well, or only have one answer and are effectively ""done"". If one answer is enough, why is one a bad number then?

&gt; Clearly any average user isn't going to check this thread repeatedly and sift through the comments to find something that they would have liked that they otherwise would have found as an individual thread with high upvotes

The average user isn't coming to the sub to tutor others either. They go to established websites for that sort of thing. That's why we made this rule, because the sheer amount of noise on the front page was deterring other would-be community members from engaging due to the low average quality of posts. If anything, putting all these questions in one place should make it *easier* for these supposed people to know where to look when coming to help. The fact that it's largely untouched shows that most visitors to the sub aren't interested in that, further validating our point. By funneling here, we're allowing for both. Sure you can make the point that having individual posts raises your visibility, but forcing it into others' face isn't exactly a noble effort to get your question answered either.

At the end of the day, I don't see us changing this rule. Those that feel that your questions are less answered here should take the hint and post somewhere where that's intended. *Like Stackoverflow*.

We are not trying to be a competitor to stackoverflow and sites like it. Reddit is ill-equipped for such things for a multitude of reasons. We are trying to maintain a healthy developer community around android development, where people talk about architecture/concepts/practices, share cool libraries/articles, discuss interesting news, etc. Imagine if you went to a meetup, and there was a contingent of people showing up every time that insisted on asking everyone their specific ""my code isn't working"" or ""I can't find this thing"" questions? People would get tired of it, and you'd probably stop going. If you want to see an example of this in action, look no further than the [Android Development](https://plus.google.com/communities/105153134372062985968) community on G+. 90% ""help me solve this problem"" sprinkled with an interesting bit of content here and there.

"&gt;And what tool did you use to compare these numbers? As far as I can tell they don't have an obvious way to get incarceration by race and income.

Income is just state household median income for that race (Census), and incarceration rates by race are reported by each state to the DoJ.

&gt;We were talking about murder but you have gone into incarceration. Frankly I have to dismiss this considering the rampant incarceration for marijuana and how it's more likely that you are going to be arrested if you are black.

1. As I discuss elsewhere in this thread, the black:white disparity in incarceration parallels that of offenders from the UCR, NCVS, and NIBRS databases, so for the purpose of the comparison the difference is immaterial. I used incarceration because I had it on hand by race for each state.

2. A majority of state inmates are charged with violent and property crimes. Many inmates have drug charges as well, but [the proportion of inmates for whom drugs are the most serious charge are a small minority.](http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie.html) Drug charges are not the main driver of incarceration.

3. There is little to no systematic bias among police arresting blacks when we compare offender proportions by race from the UCR (those actually arrested) with that of the NCVS (an independent national survey in which victims are asked about crimes they have suffered). With the newer NIBRS database, which tracks reported crimes through to arrests, we can now see that the ""clear rate"" (cases closed with an arrest) of reported crimes with black offenders is not systematically higher than with white offenders.

&gt;And this is where I find your graph odd. Black and white people don't appear past a certain income level both ways. I find it hard to believe that there are no poorer white people incarcerated and no richer black people incarcerated.

Each dot is just a state average for that race. It is very difficult to construct a similar chart at the level of individuals. However, other researchers have gotten closer by doing the same thing at the level of cities, counties, and zip codes. The result, however, is always the same - for any given level of income, blacks have far higher offending rates.",false,false,t1_culit2m,nogodsorkings1,,0,1440996368,t5_2cneq,t3_3izqck,t1_culico3,1,1441600684,0,0,culit2m,politics,1,,

The abdomen in the photos is the underside but it appears to be very fuzzy with beige fur type stuff. The fuzz is also on either side of the head in a small strip on each side. 

The head is a glossy black green with indented dots covering most of it except two small patches that are lung shaped right where the head meets the thorax.

A battlebox is just to give you a taste of how the game's focus/fury mechanics work with what are generally the factions bare bones models/casters. An all in one gives you more of how the game is actually played with units and solos. They were a limited run though, so the all in ones are becoming rarer to actually find as time goes on. Stores didn't get many of them, and most sold out pretty quickly.

As far as buying enough for two people, A single battle box or all in one will not provide you enough pieces to run anything for two people.

"**Xindi-Insectoid Olaen HEC**

*Similar Ships:* My first thought was how much it resembles the T5 Mogai family - not surprising, since that family of ships has dug itself deep into my heart, so I inevitably compare things to the Mogai family. Comparable speed and maneuverability, and bridge officer seating somewhere in the middle ground between the Mirror and Retrofit (and the T6 now that that's in the mix).

*Strengths:* It's not the nimblest or fastest of escorts, but it enjoys thick shields (1.15 modifier) and a hangar bay that can slot some pretty nice pets. It's got native support for pin-and-spike builds, with the LtC Science officer and enough Tactical seats to double up TT/TS/CSV (or TS/CSV/Attack Patterns). No Ensign seats, which means you don't wind up feeling forced to use the Lt Universal for one thing or another just to make it feel tough enough or punchy enough. It could be a tough little ship with two Emergency Powers plus ET2 and RSP, without losing out on those magnificent LtC Science abilities, or you could go full-bore on Science and whip up a drain build, which meshes nicely with its relatively balanced 5/3/3 console layout and the beastly Nandi trait.

*Weaknesses:* The specialist seating is underwhelming. Command on the LtC rings sort of hollow - unless you put a Science officer in the Universal seat, I can't think of a better use for that LtC than Science Team, Hazard Emitters, and Gravity Well. Similarly, the Pilot skills might be cool, but they're competing with valuable Tactical slots, and competing at the Ens/Lt level. I don't think Ens/Lt Pilot skills outclass Ens/Lt Tactical, in most circumstances, but you could certainly work your build around the Pilot abilities, and with Lt Eng and LtC Sci, slotting a Tac in the Universal seat doesn't compromise your durability so much that you just couldn't afford to sacrifice Tac slots for Pilot trickery. Other big downside: My brain *insists* that it's spelled ""Olean"". My brain is wrong, but this screws with my efforts to hunt for it on the Exchange.

*Build Types:* Pin and spike, no question. It absolutely screams for it, in my opinion. At the same time, though, kitting it out for drains seems pretty feasible, and it also invites torp-heavy builds. A kinetic-centric boat running EPtA/EPtS, GW, DRB, and TBR certainly appeals.

*How would I set it up?* Pin-and-spike is my first impulse. I'm a diehard gunship driver, so when I see six Tactical slots and an LtC Sci, I get all kinds of tingly - that's exactly the kind of arrangement that can make cannons really shine. Were I space-rich and inclined to drive an Olaen, I'd load her up with CSV, KLW, GW, and Plasmatic Biomatter, and go to town. To town, I say.

*Trait/Console:* The trait looks pretty good, but it's no Supremacy. It's not the kind of trait that would make me seek out the Olaen for its trait. Even if I were driving an Olaen, I don't think I'd want to make space for its trait, not when it's competing with Temporal Insight, All Hands on Deck, Supremacy, Invincible, or Emergency Weapons Cycle. Torpedo builds and Tactical Captains take EWC and Invincible off the table, respectively, though, which might make room for Council of Thought. The console I cannot properly address, but I suspect that like most ship consoles, it's mostly novelty, and it's competing with the might of some pretty amazing universals. I'd try it out, but I'd likely give it a pass in the end.",false,false,t1_culj08w,BGolightly,"@bgolightly, Gunship Guild, /r/stobuilds moderator",0,1440996850,t5_2uv5z,t3_3it7hz,t3_3it7hz,1,1441600779,0,0,culj08w,stobuilds,1,,

"I've got three. Firstly, people are going to get a lot more stupid than they already are. Everyone is arguing about technology, I think having it readily available at our fingertips will ultimately prevent us from permanently learning anything at all. It's already proven to be a cause for ADD, ADHD, depression, and all sorts of other things, whose to say it won't have some sort of backwards effect with evolution on a larger scale? Imagine it as an external extension of the brain, which it essentially is, if it is taken away, we won't have the knowledge that is so easily accessible now, nor the knowledge of how to attain the knowledge we're seeking. Secondly, I think we're going to become physically weakened over time with our ever-growing lazy lifestyles and poor dietary decisions. Lastly I think the lower and middle classes will merge, and just be the lower class, while the upper class will remain an unattainable status, that only contains an extremely small portion of the population, who leave everything to their kids.

"So this is pretty fucked up of me. When I was in High School about freshman year I think, there was a kid who would bully me all the time. I used to get called fat, or get made fun of for the way I dressed. The kid was a real jerk. I built up a lot of rage about it. I hated seeing him in school everyday. Around Sophomore year I think, his brother got diagnosed with leukemia. And it obviously fucked with him. We were only like 14 and his brother was only like 19. 

One day he was really laying into me. Giving me shit the entire class. I don't entirely remember what it was for that day, but he pissed me off to the point where I looked at him and said ""I hope your brother doesn't fucking make it"".

I have never been so disgusted with myself. He almost started crying in that class. I later apologized to him, and let him know that I knew how it felt to be so close to losing a brother. My brother was the victim of a home invasion when I was about 12, and he was actually shot in the face. The bullet shattered his jaw and it is actually surprising he lived through that.

I said that about 6 years ago, and about a year and a half ago, during the middle of my Freshman year of college, my mom texted me letting me know the kid's brother passed away. I cried for like 2 hours, because I could only think of the terrible thing I said when I was 15.

"This post title makes zero sense. I read the article because I was curious what it was actually about.

ELI5: Clusters of galaxies can contain regions of high-energy electrons that emit radio waves. Over time these electrons cool down and stop emitting radio waves. In this case, astronomers have observed a situation where two galaxy clusters collided. The energy from the collision heated the electrons back up, and they began to emit radio waves again.

This is cool! It's wild to think about what it means for two such incomprehensibly huge structures to collide. And, I'm sure this is an exciting opportunity for astronomers and astrophysicists to study the dynamics of galaxy clusters.

You're right, I missed a 0 in my calculation. Regardless comparing the number of protesters to the population is misleading, which was the point I was trying to make with comparing it to the I have a dream rally. It would be more apt to look at different protests of varying success and then see if number of protesters was a statistically significant variable. You would have to measure this against the population of the nation, and account for other variables like type of government, degree of change demanded etc, before we start to get a statistic that might actually carry some weight. 

Simply stating that the protest turnout was x% of the population gives us no insight.

"Yes. In fact, I advocate for it among people who say they ""can't believe"" but want to live virtuously and for others. I think it is a path to grace because I know of several who took a path from stoicism to Catholicism, most notably former atheist blogger Leah Libresco.

That said, I'm not sure it is of much value for someone already Catholic, since we already incorporate the best aspects of stoicism, such as virtue, utilizing natural reason and logic to take on the world, and remaining steadfast against the forces of evil, ignorance, greed, and hedonism. The parts of stoicism that aren't really compatible have to do with their pantheist cosmology and determinism. 

As an interesting aside, stoicism practices are quite en vogue among many in the intelligentsia these days, [as this article shows.](http://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2013/12/01/want-an-unconquerable-mind-try-stoic-philosophy/)",false,false,t1_ctw3p3m,Underthepun,,0,1439057637,t5_2qi4f,t3_3g9gmv,t3_3g9gmv,4,1440360866,0,0,ctw3p3m,Catholicism,4,,

Edit2: here is the list:  

&gt;Replaces HUD with effects in the status bar:

&gt;* **StatusVol**  - puts the dots in the status bar where the time is (more bells and whistles)
* **StatusVol X** - puts the dots in the status bar where the time is (less bells and whistles)
* **StatusVol 2** - puts the dots on a statusbar-sized HUD that slides down like the NC over the statusbar
* **StatusHUD 2** - puts the dots in the status bar where the time is
* **VolumeStatus 2** - adds a loudspeaker icon next to the battery with signal lines to indicate volume
* **Snapchat Volume Statusbar** - replaces the volume HUD with the snapchat one in the statusbar

&gt;Replaces HUD with banner-style sliders:

&gt;* **VolumeBar** - turns the volume HUD into a volume slider at the top of the screen
* **VolumeBanner** - turns the volume HUD into a volume slider at the top of the screen
* **VolumeSlider** -  turns the volume HUD into a volume slider at the top of the screen

&gt;Modifies/removes the HUD (doesn't provide a replacement):

&gt;* **NoVolumeHUD** (by maximehip) - removes the volume HUD
* **No Volume HUD** (by greensnow) - removes the volume HUD
* **Better HUD** - allows you to modify and move the volume HUD
* **HUD Customizer** - allows you to customize elements of the volume HUD

&gt;Other modifications:

&gt;* **TinyWool** - turns the volume HUD into a smaller strip only showing the dots at the top of the screen

"I'll be honest. I'm no Steve Jobs, or Bill Gates, but I am a pretty regular dude. Right now I'm waiting for my second year of college to start and I've had a job my whole first year. The job sucks by the way; cashier at a dumb jewish store. My career before college wasn't something to stride for; at most a B. Now though, I've stepped up and have atleast a 3.5 GPA going into year 2.

My family and I are moving so I'm glad to quit my job and relax a bit, but I am still intent on working (for really no reason.) I'll be applying soon.

Happiness? I'm abnormally happy. I'm all positivity, the only happy looking one at my job (besides like 2 other people) and enough friends with stuff to do. I laugh a lot and make jokes all the time. The usual happy-go-lucky guy with crazy humor to ammuse people. I seem pretty successful for what I'm doing.

There's always anxiety in my life. Mine is NOWWHERE near the extent of others, but I do deal with it and worry about all the crucial things. I still get nervewrecked when I think about transferring, or getting gokd grades, or driving a car, or taxes, or life. The CRUCIAL life choices give me anxiety and when it's something small like homework then I just procrastinate. I'm also lazy.

Getting a gf isn't stress inducing at all. I'm a pretty confident dude, but I just don't care. As hilarious as writing that sentence is, it's inly because I was never BENT on getting a girlfriend. I never needed one. By this point though, being 18 and overjoyed, I would absolutely LOVE to smother someone and make them mine. I have WAY too much happiness and oversaturated love in me and I need a balance for that. I would just love to have someone to be with. Legit Netflix and chill lol that's my goal. I know HOW to get one, but I'm not ambitious. The reason I choose not to care, while knowingly WANTING it to happen, is because if you have it be a priority and nothing goes well, then you don't have to be put down by it. I choose to live life day by day just chillin and going as time flows. I wouldn't want something that I care about, especially a goal, to get in the way of my own constructed happiness.

That's pretty much it haha if I missed anything then please tell me. Sorry for not responding sooner.

"Use this as a guide for building tools to become a malware analyst, or even some other role you might like more such as pen tester, network security, programming..etc. 

Tool 1: programming
Intermediate: C++, python (dont start with C)
Quickest way to learn and have fun with it is to program tools that will help you do your job better. Even if there are tools online, try making your own first. Really learn and understand how the tool works. 

Tool 2: education
Certs: A+, Network+, Security+, CEH
Books: malware analysts cookbook, practical malware analysis, windows internals, windows api, cert books, ida pro, c++, python books, x86 assembly
Online: read security feeds like mcafee, symantec, eset, kaspersky blogs...etc. Google everything you dont know. Like ""darkcomet analysis"" or ""best debugger for malware"".

Tool 3: experience
Get a job as a security contractor for the govt, certs will make you eligible, get clearance too through them if possible, itll only open more doors and allow you more experience. Or join a private company if you can find a junior position, not easy though. 
On your own read online forums, ask questions, find malware and analyze it, swim in malware and pick something and learn everything about it, like zbot or some other popular malware where there are endless online analysis's. Read those articles and blogs and follow along on your own. Learn other peoples techniques and pay attention to the tools they use. Theres no one way to do it, see how everyone else is doing it. 

Tool 4: passion
You have to like learning this field because you will never stop learning. If you find it a burden to learn new things this may not be right for you. Aint easy when things change so often and you have to keep up. Passion, motivation are the only things that will make you succeed. Dont be that guy that thinks he knows everything because people wont want to hire or work with you. I cant emphasize enough how just having the willingness to learn will open many doors for you. 

With those 4 fundemental tools youll be set to start building your foundation which your malware analysis career will be built upon. Doing it only for the money will get you nowhere, other than some lame ass position teaching you nothing. Follow the opportunities, because experience is worth more than salary in this business.

Sentimental physical things and mementos are just things and can easily be taken away from us. You could lose that diamond or your wedding rings on trips and places you go and lose them forever. What matters is what's in your head, the memories, the feelings you can never erase. That is enough.

 Isn't it hard enough to the other person to realize that she isn't the ""one""? The first or the only one? Does she deserve to be reminded every day too? 
 
Love is complex and it brings out the best and worse from all of us. If you choose to love another then give all you can, you can never really give your all because your wife took some of that with her but you can give what's left and sometimes when that other person loves you back that is enough.

"real answer:  Big money companies *do* have some influence in China, through a variety of methods.  Primarily, they partner with Chinese citizens.  Especially powerful people in the Chinese government.

A company like Nike will partner with a Chinese official (or his brother, cousin, etc) when forming their China division, so the Chinese citizen has part ownership or high end executive powers.  Then if their brand gets copied, you get to have a *Chinese citizen* file the infringement suit, and often a citizen with political influence in the Chinese courts.

Partnering with foreign countries citizens in this way is pretty standard when it comes to international trade.  Hell, a lot of countries require a domestic partner or owner by law.

"Thanks for your comments! I wanted to shed some light on the supernatural creatures, though for the most part they really aren't a huge part of the story other than relating to Anna's job. Much like in Buffy (which KotN has taken inspiration from), there are creatures all over the world that call Arendelle their home. This is lampshaded in the summary, which refers to Arendelle as being on top of a hellmouth--meaning there's a huge mishmash of dangerous creatures around. 

There's honestly not a lot of rhyme or reason behind choosing the creatures themselves...I basically look up different ones until I find one whose characteristics fit the plot. The fact that I've kept their original names is so readers can look them up easier and I won't accidentally be plagiarizing anything. Also, it's much more fun to use creatures from all around the world rather than sticking with one culture's--there's a lot more variation in the fights that way.

"I got my PharmD first (6 year program) then applied and am working on the PhD. My opinion is that 1) PharmD is still heavily underrepresented and somewhat ""new"" to the clinical doctorate field. So we have to work a little harder to get it recognized. More importantly 2) Most of the larger MD/phD, DDS/PhD programs are primarily funded through NIH, and have larger lobbying groups for doing benchside research. 

That being said, if anyone is looking to do actual clinical work I wouldn't recommend doing the combined programs because it'll take 6-7+ years before being able to practice and dividing the work between lab and clinic creates an environment where clinical skills are somewhat lacking until you get real experience.

"Ask for help in a sincere manner, try to contact someone friendly directly and ask them for some 1 on 1 time. If you don't get the help and you can't figure it out, leave. Do not rot away in a corp you don't enjoy being a part of. 

If you aren't already in a new player friendly corp, join one. There are lots that are designed around teaching you how to play. Karmafleet, Pandemic Horde, Bravenewbies are prime examples. Eve-Uni obviously has the wiki and does a lot for their players but your top end content will be a bit out of reach there, RvB I hear is great for PVP learning but I have no personal experience with them. Find the one that you feel fits your personality best and join them. They all have great new player support systems. Each is pretty easy to size up via Reddit and the forums, each has their own unique culture and tone.

Culture and tone are ultimately what's important, if either doesn't sit right with you, you aren't going to have fun. On the upside, there are thousands of corps to pick from, there is one out there that you will love, find it.

Finally, get over the death thing. I spent my first 3 months playing Eve making sure I never died, it was 3 months wasted. Don't worry about being an expert, there is always going to be some guy who has played for 10 years that is going to figure out a way to smoke you in whatever you are flying regardless of what he is flying.

Maybe it's just me but I feel like a lot of parents don't fully understand what cosigning actually means. If they don't want to take any responsibility for the debt, they shouldn't cosign. Period. Yes, their kid will probably hate them for a while... but they might be surprised by the types of solutions some students come up with when private loans aren't an option.

I'm not a huge fan of the big chart of -1 this and +2 that modifiers. 

My players still wanted to game, but we kept butting up against the fact that... well... none of us really liked the system. So we chucked it and started a 5e game, which is running just fine. I love advantage/disadvantage, which is as simple, elegant and intuitive that SW puts a lot of effort into *telling* us it is, without actually being so.

So I see the wobbles and now I am confused because my first inclination with those wobbles is the ""I"" being too high.  Which is the opposite of what I was thinking from your previous description of issues where I thought I was too low.  You might need to do a full tuning session or find people with similar builds and try their PIDs as a starting place.


You should start by learning what pids are and basic tuning procedures.

"But all they've done since TDB is make life easier and easier for people like you.  You might be 'marginalized' by hardcore players but you certainly haven't been by the guys making the game...  you've been almost their sole focus and with each release since then including TTK, they have put more and more emphasis on rewarding the type of player that you are.  

What I'm asking for is the first return to focusing some attention on the hardcore players.  That's not a crazy thing to ask, and it doesn't have to alienate anybody because the option is always there if somebody can find the time to do it.  When you look at it from the other end, they are implementing a bunch of 'changes' that won't even be seen or experienced by regular players of this game, including guys who play at your speed, and that's not fair either.  I don't give a shit about an instant boost to level 25, 98% of this subreddit had 3 level 32 characters 6 months ago and we've just been twiddling our thumbs ever since in terms of progression.  HoW took even casual players all of about 2 weeks to get all their guys maxed out, the hardcores were all 34's in a matter of days.  

There has to be more to it than that.  If they can't figure out a way to balance out replay-ability and long term progression for serious players vs approachability and short term rewards for people like yourself, then they are failing.  I'm hoping the whole 'xp to level 40' thing is just there to appease the crybabies who hated being stuck on levels 25-29 back in vanilla and that there really is still a grind to light levels and such that is meaningful but not mandatory.  but based on the last two expansions and how this one looks, i'm doubtful.  and i think they will lose a lot of hardcore players if that's the case, which is a shame because we've been very patient.

So most of my classes had between 8 and 14 students and my largest class was under 30. Instead of all my classes being in math and computer science I had requirements to do volunteer work in the community, religious studies, anthropology, philosophy, government, and art classes ontop of the standard English and math classes that are part of most curriculum. I still took between 2 and 3 major related classes every semester despite all the other requirements.

"The Koch Brother's barely broke the top ten in political donations in the last election.
Does Bernie Sander believe that massive financial contributions to presidential campaigns only undermines the democratic process when his political enemies do it? Surely not!

"You're spot on. The only thing I could add is: it's called *social* media for a reason. You have to participate. If all you do is talk and not listen, people will avoid you. You'll look like every other ""Social Media Guru"" who only ever posts on LinkedIn. People want to have a conversation, and that means participating in the resharing systems social media offers.

It's a fundamental mistake people make in networking in all its forms. You can't go into a meetup or a conference or a twitter conversation thinking about how these people are going to help you make money. You have to go in thinking about how you're going to be helpful and friendly, the kind of person people *want* to be around, to invite back to the next party.

To that end, if I'm in a new group, I'm just there to make friends. If anything, I hope to be able to connect two completely unrelated people. For example, I ended up talking to a person working on some film projects and got them in contact with a friend of mine who is also working on film in a complementary way. That doesn't go anywhere near making me money. What it does is helps to keep me out of the pile of creepers who are there just to make a buck. That's not why I do it--I do it to just be nice and help people--but the side effect is that people tend to want to start more conversations with me.

You have to have a taoist approach to it. You will succeed when you stop caring about succeeding. Start caring about helping people. Don't ask what the world owes you; it owes you nothing. Ask what you owe the world. And when you help someone, they almost universally will look to help you out in some way.

Building a social media following is not something that happens overnight, or in a week, or in a month. If you start now, post every day, participate with others, actually be a member of the community, in 6 months you'll have a small group of followers. In a year, it will be bigger. It's not a tool you leverage to your own benefit--that's a narcissistic approach and people see through it. It's a community of individuals with their own goals and own motivations that you participate in that wants to give back to you.",false,false,t1_cu9qpte,moron4hire,,0,1440094603,t5_2qldo,t3_3hq6s7,t1_cu9n3nf,5,1441368642,0,0,cu9qpte,Entrepreneur,5,,
"Yeah, but ""I don't feel like it"" will only work for so long. 

Drinking is different from other things in life; it's usually a social experience that people do when they're around their friends and is considered as something that brings people together. People in their 20's usually are very intrigued by people who don't drink, and usually conversations don't end at ""No, I don't drink, thanks though."" People, for whatever reason, are *compelled* to know why someone doesn't drink. For what it's worth, I'm not one of those people. Someone tells me they don't drink or don't want to drink, our conversation about drinking ends there and I move on. For what seems like the vast of majority of people, though, that's not how those conversations go. Usually someone will ask ""Why not?"", and ""I don't feel like it."" isn't a good enough answer for them; there's gotta be some reason you don't feel like it. 

If you asked someone 15 days in a row if they want a free doughnut and they always say ""No, I don't feel like it."", eventually you're probably going to wonder why they don't ""feel like it""; are they on a diet? Were they once obese? Are they allergic to deliciousness? You may not ACTUALLY ask the question, but you'd probably wonder it to yourself. People don't normally stop themselves from those types of questions when it comes to alcohol as inquiring minds want to know. Especially since, if done properly and safely, drinking with friends is an overall enjoyable experience for the large majority of the population who partake. 

You should really think about why you ""don't feel like drinking"". You don't want to admit it the reason to us, which is fine, but you should be able to admit it to yourself. I only say that because, as a 21 year old in (presumably) North America, having never had even a sip of alcohol in your life is not the norm (norm only meaning done by the majority), and any female (or male, whatever floats your boat) you enter into a relationship with who drinks, or has friends who drink, probably won't take ""Nah, don't feel like it"" as an acceptable answer for too long. They're not entitled to your reason by any means, but that doesn't mean they'll give up on trying to pry it out of you. 

All that being said: if you're in school or are part of a well-enough sized city, you should look into ""Straight-edge"" groups in your area. Straight-edge people don't partake in using alcohol, tobacco, or any other drugs. Sounds like they'd be right up your alley and, presumably, wouldn't need to know your reasons behind not drinking!

"**Hudson and Troop**  
 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/baad51113fce487dc83707aff5ab752a.png)  

&gt; The brainchild of Melbourne’s Travis Aulsebrook, Hudson &amp; Troop is a musical project coming into fruition in 2014. With origins lying somewhere in the minimalist folk pop scene, the latest release (Frameless single, April 6) sees an evolution into a more experimental pop direction whilst still maintaining a defining focus on strong lyricism and a heartfelt delivery.

&gt; Born and bred in Fremantle Western Australia, Travis made the move to Melbourne in 2011. Quickly establishing himself amongst the strong local scene of singer-songwriters, he made an impressive recording debut with the Open Up Slowly EP (released under the original moniker of Hudson). The first single Against The Grain became a viral sensation with a stop-motion, kaleidoscopic music video starring none other than coloured pencils, racking up close to two million plays on Youtube and Vimeo combined. This led to a plethora of sync opportunities and established a strong following on newly appearing streaming services such as Spotify.

&gt; His second EP, The Undertow, was released in 2013. Working with critically acclaimed local producer Nick Huggins, the five track ethereal folk-pop offering further cemented Travis’s place as an artist to watch. Stand out tracks Marble Streets and One &amp; One earned favour with the tastemakers at Triple J, and found sync opportunities in overseas markets.

&gt; Inspired by the diverse and dynamic recordings of local producer, Pip Norman, Travis began collaborating with the multi-award winning artist in late 2013. Known for his work with Australian hip-hop pioneers TZU, Urthboy, blues and roots powerhouse Ash Grunwald, and Sparkadia, the combination of analog synths and electronic experimentation layered over a folk-pop foundation makes for a unique sound that has already piqued industry attention. Indulging his passion for music videos that push the traditional boundaries, the new single Frameless is set to launch with a clip starring a blue-furred, impressively-horned beast created by the Sharp FX team (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings). Directed by the J-Award winning, ARIA nominated team of Darcy Prendergast and Andrew Goldsmith (OH YEAH WOW), the creature conveys the poignant lyrics via AUSLAN sign language, producing a visually striking and engaging clip that is set to impress.

"Main issue with your idea is the whole ""Reroll after every boss"" part. That would be too much for RK + Gilgabot to handle.


I think a possible acceptable variation to that would be to assign 4 Random Jobs at each Crystal part, and you're only allowed to use the 4 Active ones you have at the time. And it's Natural too.

So for example, the start of the run I am given Knight, White Mage, Black Mage, Monk. So Bartz = Knight, Lenna = White Mage, Faris = Black Mage, Galuf = Monk. Once I get the Water Crystal, Gilgabot rerolls all 4 jobs and I am then given Mystic Knight, Summoner, Blue Mage, and Berserker. Now Bartz is Mystic Knight, Lenna is Summoner, and so forth.


I see complications with this one though, especially on the site with showing what each player's current available jobs are. 


Another idea was more of the FF# style runs instead of just Classic FF1. Something like FFIV, where instead of being given a specific job, each FFV Character is assigned a character from FFIV, and their available jobs are matched to what the character in FFIV is. I.e Edge would be both a Thief and a Ninja, Rydia would be Black Mage and Summoner, Edward is Bard, Tellah is Red Mage, Rosa is White Mage and Ranger(She has Aim sooo...), etc.

"It would be a ""hate"" crime, as hate crimes are defined as crimes motivated by a specific (protected) characteristic of the victim. 

If a white guy shoots a black guy because he is black - that would be considered a hate crime. If a white guy shoots a black guy because he is a jerk - that would not be considered a hate crime. 

Likewise, black guy shoots white guy because he's white - that's a hate crime. Black guy shoots white guy because he is a jerk - not a hate crime. 

Racism is a little different. Racism is the belief that a race is inherently inferior (or inherently superior). Likewise, sexism is the belief that people of a certain gender are inferior. This is different than prejudice and stereotyping.  Prejudice is a preconceived idea not based on fact. A stereotype is a widely held belief that is fixed and oversimplified. While these concepts are similar, they each have specific definitions and are not interchangeable. 

An example (assuming ""Cindy"" is a fully qualified candidate and meets the job requirements). Let's say Cindy doesn't get the job because the boss doesn't think a woman can do the job as well as a man - that's sexism. Cindy doesn't get the job because the boss doesn't think black people can do the job well - that's racism. Cindy doesn't get the job because the boss thinks blondes are airheads - now the boss is stereotyping. Did you notice how none of those things have anything to do Cindy as an individual? Nothing to do with her education, experience, abilities? Those are all problems. Big ones. 

But another big problem, the type that people often pretend doesn't exist, is that there are several very valid reasons why Cindy would not get the job. Perhaps Candidate B has more experience. Perhaps B is more of a team player, maybe B has a more pleasant demeanor, maybe B has fewer restrictions regarding overtime, maybe B has more established relationships with the clients, maybe Cindy is just a big old bitch. All would be valid reasons to hire Candidate B.

"Working my way through the video, adding bullet points as I go:

* to start with, you're running a longer engagement build. Between the icebreaker and the pulse rifle you just don't have anything for close-mid range
* on quite a few occasions you get caught close range where you can't compete
* during the first objective you focus too much on the actual objective, you missed at least 3 grenade throws by shooting for the objective, not the enemy.
*  reposition more, you kept attacking from the same 2 angles on the first objective- considering your longer range guns, I'd have tried to snipe from B heavy on them, out of range of their shotguns and TLW.
* if you manage to wipe the team, then push for the objective. But don't stay, you don't have the cqc defense to hold that lower heavy zone
* right before first heavy spawn you dropped the titan, then tried to snipe the warlock. Not only were you one-shot, your icebreaker wasn't all the way leveled out for the snipe before you went back out
* you stood still on upper heavy first spawn, always fire and forget then reposition.
* you rushed pretty blindly after your first respawn when they still had heavy.
* their team had a pretty solid pattern: set up a perimeter AROUND the objective, farm kills, get the objective after they wiped you guys, spread out again. 
* you continued to rush, even with a super this is risky - they're clearly watching their flanks instead of blindly grouping up, with only the defender bubble accounted for you were definitely risking a counter super
* you move A LOT when you snipe. In a lot of different directions. Slow it down a bit. Probably this is the tilt coming in, just remind yourself it's a game, and set up somewhere you know they'll be headed to, instead of trying to force it
* second heavy is a great example: you were still blind firing at the warlock while the titan was coming around to your side. If you'd broken off earlier you'd have more time to prepare for the next fight
* nice icebreaker/melee combo on the titan, he walked right into that
* not so nice: spamming PR afterwards when they had heavy. Slow it down and you could've had them
* after that you get a kill on a sloppy warlock, but then you try and challenge a TLW on the stairs. When I have long ranged guns there, I always fall back to the wall/hallway that loops around to A, more cover, and further away so the hipfire TLW will have a harder time
* you continue to walk into shotgun/TLW range with your PR. It's never gonna work
* side note: I'd recommend trying a conduit from FWC with headseeker, much easier 3 burst kills than yoursyours

&amp;nbsp;

I'm gonna stop there for now. Tbh a lot of it looks like tilt- you start missing shots you should be landing. The other half is poor positioning - you need to use cover and have a quick escape route planned when you double up on longer range guns like that. 

&amp;nbsp;

"For MBB interviews, I'm very curious to know what actually happens behind the scene. 

Firstly, is there a specific rubric candidates are being graded on, or is it more of a general discussion about the impression and case solving capabilities? I guess each consultant sort of can determine whether or not a candidate is viable (is it normally clear-cut as to a candidate either has it or not?), but for ones who ultimately pass the round, do they have to have 100% of interviewers approving?

Secondly, how does office matching really work exactly? I was asked to provide 3-5 offices of my preference, but how do they match candidates to each office, as in who gets their 1st preference/priority to interview at popular places (is there a quantified grade of some sort or matter of first-in-first-out, which would then put people from certain geographies at disadvantage)?

"I have 74 games with Viper and a 66% winrate.  Viper is definitely an extremely strong laner and can transition into a monster in the midgame if you play him right.  Lategame he doesn't have to be as lackluster as people seem to think, but his role definitely changes.  In the early game he dominates the lane.  In the midgame he is, in my opinion, one of the strongest heroes out there.  Lategame your role is to absorb damage, give out Viper Strikes like you're OPrah Winfrey, and attack anyone who is low health (or someone squishy, if nobody is low percentage-wise).

The key to not throwing games with Viper is to find ways to capitalize on your advantage by giving the largest possible advantage to the rest of your team.  In the laning phase this means that picking your lane is very important.  Viper can offlane or safelane.  Which one shoud depend on where your enemy's most important hero is.  If they have a mid Shadow Fiend that is going to dominate the game, then you should go mid and stop him from getting his farm.  If they have a Slark in the safelane who's going to get out of control once he gets shadow blade, you can easily keep him on the defence and limit his farm if you go offlane.

I checked your viper games on Dotabuff, and I think your itemization needs some work.  The first few items on Viper are basically static.  My build on Viper goes **Aquila - Treads - Mek - Aghs**.  Every game.  Every single game.  I only change if another hero is building mek, in which case I go straight into Aghs.  This build gives you mana to spam your spells, and a ton of tankiness to survive fights.  That's all you really need as Viper, because Nethertoxin will provide the damage that you're not building.  Once you have Mek on Viper you can begin to teamfight, pushing down towers easily (as Nethertoxin gives extra damage against towers).  The money from tower pushes should help you get a fast Aghs.

After Aghs, items on Viper differ a lot.  BKB gives you extra tankiness and lets you keep casting if the enemy has lots of stuns or silences.  Butterfly helps against physical damage and hugely increases your damage potential.  Guardian Greaves helps with pushing power and sustain, plus it can remove pesky silences.  Sange&amp;Yasha is easy to build into when you need tankiness and chase power.  Solar Crest and Heaven's Halberd are both very strong on Viper as well.

I noticed that you build Manta Style a lot.  This is a subpar item on Viper.  Yes the illusions get Corrosive Skin, but they deal very little damage because they don't get Nethertoxin.  It doesn't allow you to capitalize on any of your advantages, and doesn't give you as much tankiness as some other items do.  If you can afford Manta you should probably go Butterfly instead.  I would also avoid Orchid, as it doesn't give enough advantage at the timing you'll have it at (assuming you build core items first).

In terms of skill-build, you seem to be doing well.  You usually want to be 1-1-1 by level three, and then go from there.  My rule for Viper is as follows:

* if you're taking harass or trading hits, level corrosive skin
* if you're hitting them far more than they hit you, level nethertoxin

Usually at level 7 I have either 1-3-2-1 or 1-2-3-1 as my build.  Poison attack is maxed last in more than 95% of my games.

Finally, to answer your core question, the key to keeping your advantage after taking T2s is to make space for your team to take rax.  Roam the map with one or two of your allies and try and pick off a key hero with your (now long range) Viper Strike.  Once you've taken out a core hero, push high-ground and take a rax.  Repeat this until you win.  This is how you stop Viper from falling off in the late game.  Instead of trying to carry your team like you did for the first 35 minutes, you are now the space creator on the map and the crowd controller in fights.  If you have any other questions feel free to PM me or reply.

"Thanks. I think your points about fragmentation are well taken. It is interesting, though, that Social History meant something different in the UK than in the US. Did American historians have more trouble with theory (at least before postmodernism)? Bruce Laurie begins his Artisans Into Workers by asking why there was never any credible Socialism in America. 

I do think there was more interest between the wars, and especially popular interest. People like Lundberg followed in the footsteps of muckrakers like Ida Tarbell and regularly named names. But even by the time you get to someone like Domhoff in the sixties, a transition has been made from stories of people to data on groups. Who Rules America is a much different book from America's 60 Families or even The Rich and the Super Rich (which Lundberg published a year after Domhoff). Not that Lundberg lacks data!

"Since alot of my experience is with Brick and Morter stores, I doin't know how many juice vendors are here on Reddit.

Of all the juices I've tried so far, and there are a ton more to be had, I am really digging their stuff. Plus, they are a Jersey-Based E-Juice company. I gotta show my love locally. For the Reddit side of things, after seeing their clean room and having bought 2 bottles (the Hades and Athena), I gotta give /u/MercuryCV for producing great juices. The Hades really hits home as a nice afternoon Vape. Man, I love me some Coffee E-Juice as I cut my own consumption of Caffeine down.

"&gt;Saying Adams is not a great fit because they maxed out Kanter doesn't make any sense. They maxed out Kanter because other wise they would lose him for nothing, now they can at least trade him later or ride out his contract with the rising cap. Neither reason has anything to do with Adams being a good fit. 

Why would they trade for Kanter in the first place if they were happy with Adams? Come on dude.

&gt;Saying that OKC's plan boiled down to developing Jeremy Lamb is a straw man argument, you're simplifying the situation to make it easier to criticize. I stated quite clearly that James Harden was a player they didn't really want for a price they couldn't really afford. You're suggesting that OKC thought all their problems would go away by acquiring a young prospect and developing him, I don't think any FO is that naive.

I know that OKC didn't really want Harden, that's why they traded him away for nothing. I think that was a dumb decision to come to.

&gt;Suggesting that because they haven't reached the finals again that the trade was bad is completely ignoring the context of why they didn't reach the finals. They lost one playoffs healthy in 2013, Ibaka was injured the next postseason, Durant the next.

The team was inarguably weaker without Harden. Yes, injuries derailed their seasons, but Westbrook, Harden, and KD made the finals when they were still young, and all 3 have only gotten better.

&gt;The knicks had a healthy Amar'e and Carmelo play a reasonable amount of games together to realize they couldn't really share the floor together. Add in another big who needs to be near the basket and you run out of floor space.

I don't think Amar'e was very healthy by the time Melo got there but we are rapidly straying away from the point.

&gt;Suggesting that two of your three highest paid players should split minutes is silly. You want to talk about history? Find teams that did what you're suggesting and still won. ""I'll give you a hint, it's not many!""

Lol. Think about that statement. You want an example of a championship team that had one of its best players come off the bench? I'll give you a hint, the guy that did still sits on a bench.

"That's not exactly 100% true. 

Modern hunters usually field dress deer (drain blood, remove entrails) and then [hang them several days](http://www.fieldandstream.com/blogs/hunting/2011/01/how-long-do-you-hang-your-deer) to ensure blood has been completely drained and to start aging the meat. If you go into the back woods of many states during hunting season, it's not uncommon to see deer hanging from trees. Plus, to this day people dry age raw meat, granted under controlled conditions, but still it happens. 

Raw meat in a dry, arid environment doesn't necessarily go bad. There are records of raw meat being turned into jerky in Egypt in 6500 BC simply by leaving strips of it in the sun, and likely it happened before that.

AFAIK the biggest concern with meat is bacteria, and removing the internal organs as quickly as possible prevents a lot of the damage that they would do. Considering the guy ran for 8 hours, he is likely going to do everything he can to lessen the amount he'll have to carry.

"Danny Rolling. Aka the Gainesville Ripper. 

Rolling raped and killed a few college students in town. What he was really known for was displaying the body in a disgusting way.

For example, one victim...

"&gt;Okay, that's fair. If any of them genuinely believe that a christian wedding would send someone to hell, they can discriminate as they please.
And any reason is license enough for discrimination unless law prevents it. People can freely choose how they treat people unless they directly hurt them.

So you're saying that the Jim Crow South didn't hurt anyone? That when people systematically decided not to serve blacks that didn't put undue burden on them? Cause that's your argument. And what you're arguing for.

&gt;No, but there is a link. if you force a business to do something you're forcing it's owner to do something. That's not freedom.

Except that you choose to open a business. You agree to the rules. And as I said before you're free not to incorporate. You're just not protected as if you did.

&gt;That verse is OT, which was fulfilled by the coming of christ, which made it such that there was no chosen people and therefore no need to preserve the chosen people by means of eugenics.

&gt;Various testimonies, through romans and others have stated that homosexuality is a sin- therefore, it would make sense that their marriage is also a sin, and so is helping them. Unless you're one of those sola scriptua folks.

“For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass the law until all is accomplished.  Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.”  (Matthew 5:18-19 RSV)

All of the vicious Old Testament laws will be binding forever.  ""It is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass away than for the smallest part of the letter of the law to become invalid.""  (Luke 16:17 NAB)

Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill.  Amen, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place.""  

So no. The Old Testament According to JESUS FUCKING CHRIST says it still applies. 

Those testimonies weren't made by Jesus, nor were they God speaking in the first person. Or do you believe that women are beneath men:1 Timothy 2:12 

Masking bigotry with religion is disgusting. Christians are fine with people who eat pork ordering a cake. People getting married for the 4th time ordering a cake. With the wealthy ordering a cake. With a woman with a job ordering a cake. But a gay guy? Nope.

"&gt; if any individual is fearful of any information, that's up to them to percieve it in a negative light

No: When the 'information' is predictions of apocalypse or otherwise an 'end to life as we know it', you can't say it's just 'perceived in a negative light'. That's a chickenshit attitude. 

I could just as easily call someone a 'n\*gger', being the white guy I am, and pretend that, if they take it wrong, ""oh, you're just perceiving it wrong - I didn't mean it like that"". That'd be a total lack of responsibility on my part – I wouldn't be *owning my words* – just as OP isn't owning his post. When OP says he doesn't believe in this stuff *usually*, the implication is obvious that he does *in this instance*, and therefore he's pushing an agenda he believes in, regardless if this isn't his own original material.

&gt; there's not a doubt in my mind that something is going on

The thing is though, that there's literally zero evidence that anything is. It's all just loosely associated dots and imaginary connections. The real common thread here is just the whole 'don't trust science' angle, exactly the same way that Flat Earthers push. 

On that note: I could make just as many loose associations in exactly the same way and show this whole thing is just barely-concealed anti-semitism, or differently, show that this is just part of the ongoing campaign to undermine scientific advancement (again: these guys have a lot of similar conclusions that Flat Earthers do). But just because I can show those associations wouldn't make them valid all on their own, right? I still wouldn't be able to *evidence any of it*.

The same is true for the loose associations saying it's all a conspiracy to bring about the end times or some Hindu god of destruction. I mean you said it yourself: Perception. I can perceive (read: come up with an explanation) this 9/23 thing in any number of ways using the same evidence, so why should anyone trust one assertion over another? Simple: They've got preconceptions of overarching conspiracy and global domination, so that's what they see. Same reason why overzealous christians see Jesus in the wood-grain of a door, or the Virgin Mary on a sandwich. Preconceptions. 

Closing note: In the story of Chicken Little, the chicken actually *believed* the sky was falling. It's still a story about the dangers of fear mongering, because Chicken Little *was* fear mongering. Even if he believed his words.

"Man, there are sooo many conservative viewpoints I love.
   
1. Strict environmental controls to protect the environment we all share.  Nixon (1) created the EPA, (2) championed and signed the Clean Air Act, and (3) prominently featured environmental issues in his first State of the Union address.  He might have been the most pro-environmental regulation President we've ever had.  http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Richard_Nixon_Environment.htm.  
   
2. High tax rates for top wage earners.  Nixon, Eisenhower, and their predecessors had no qualms about taxing our country's highest earners appropriately.  And that wasn't just inaction on their part--they took affirmative action to tax high earners.  In 1969 and 1971, Nixon signed a tax reform package that gave low-income tax payers a break, and paid for it with $6.6 billion in tax increases for high earners, resulting in a top tax bracket of 70%.  http://iret.org/pub/BLTN-101.PDF.  Even that rate would've shocked Ike, however, since he signed off on a 91% top tax rate (in fairness, he pushed hard to get it down from 92%, but also in fairness, he didn't ask for something like the ~33% top tax rate we have now--that'd just be crazy!).  http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2013-01-02/1950s-tax-fantasy-is-a-republican-nightmare.
   
3. Limited, highly-controlled military spending.  Man, Ike was such dove!  That dude never met a military spending bill he liked, and fought constantly with the military over their requests for funds he didn't think were needed.  And when he talked about military spending, he sounded like SUCH a hippie.  For example: ""Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.  This world in arms is not spending money alone.  It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.  The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.  It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000.  It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.  We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat.  We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.  This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.  This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.""  http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/robert-schlesinger/2011/09/30/the-origins-of-that-eisenhower-every-gun-that-is-made-quote.

"I have a pair of B215A that I've owned for over 7 years. They're great speakers for the price and will easily fill any house party, and are effective to about a 30-50ft radius outdoors. They're built to survive some physical abuse and I wouldn't hesitate to bring them somewhere like Mojave/BRC because they're relatively inexpensive to replace. They seem to have overwhelmingly positive reviews on every site where they're sold, and most of the negative reviews contradict my experiences with them. If you need anything bigger, RENT it and you can go as big as you need/can afford.

Assuming that they're in excellent condition and you're happy with the sound they put out, go for it.

Edit: I should have read your post more closely. This is a DECENT deal but if you don't need them don't go for it. I really prefer my Yamaha HS8 monitors for practicing and recording mixes because they bring out a lot of detail that gets lost in the Behringers. I use the B215As when I want to provide music for others (house party / small outdoor gathering) and need more volume than the Yamahas will put out.

For your situation I'd think that the upgraded controller plus a decent set of studio monitors would serve you well.

"&gt;My friend has already told me he has gone to jummah only to find the same girl at a party that we both went to that night drinking. The cherry-pickers make me laugh. 

Okay, story time!

When I was around 16, I was still fairly religious so I would attend these 'khalaqahs' that they organised around the country. They were essentially seminars in mosques where teenagers would sit in a cirlce and talk about Islam (literally a mental circle-jerk). These would go on for the whole weekend so we would bring sleeping bags and stay in the mosque. It was for both boys and girls but they were segregated at all times (including different buses &amp; different dining rooms). Since I was doing really well in my Islamic studies and well on the way to become a Hafiz, they named me one of 'amir's when I was 17. I had already left Islam at that point so I only went because my parents forced me to...and boy I don't regret going.

What I didn't know before was that only the regular attendees were sex-segregated, and mixing was allowed behind the scenes. As I was an 'amir', I would join the other 'amirs/amiras' after dinner for some *religious* talk. Believe me, you've never seen true horniness until you've been in a room full of sex-repressed muslim teenagers. The funniest part was that the children of imams were the horniest. I ended up having so much sex in mosque bathrooms that to this day I have to think about Jabba the Hutt to not get an erection when I'm in a wudhu khana. 

I had completely left Islam by the following year, but I went to their 'khalaqahs' just for fun.

My point is that all of them thought they were good muslims at the time, and some of them still do. Humans are so full of contradictions that we offen have two opposite thoughts at the same time. Maybe the cherry-pickers are annoying and dishonest, but we're much better off with them instead of the others.",false,false,t1_cu9vwx2,QuisCustodietI,Since 2008,0,1440102357,t5_2s7k2,t3_3hphad,t1_cu9u6ax,2,1441371091,0,0,cu9vwx2,exmuslim,2,,

"It seems you are possibly discussing piracy or piracy-related topics. Although this is neither against reddit's rules nor our own, it's important to remember to be responsible. Content creators can only create said content because they receive funding from you.

Piracy is an important freedom in our sometimes restrictive societies, and it's important to remember these things before you pass judgement either way:

* Some pirate something that they already bought simply to remove the DRM.
* Some pirate to re-obtain something they already bought.
* Some pirate to try products before they make a financial commitment to them.
* Some pirate simply because they cannot afford it.
* Some pirate to get something that's no longer available.
* Some pirate because their country censors or doesn't import it.

Lastly, here's a few tips: AdBlock is awesome for hiding fake download links. [Deluge](http://deluge-torrent.org/) is an excellent open-source client that [isn't in close cooperation with the MPAA](http://libcom.org/forums/news/utorrent-bought-mpaa) (unlike uTorrent, **uninstall it as soon as possible**). Oh, and remember: torrenting in itself isn't illegal, and it's definitely not piracy! It's simply a method of transferring files. It's what you transfer that matters.

No, it's not important that the Ottomans discriminated against Jews less than Europe did. That is whataboutism, and it doesn't at all justify or change the fact that the Ottomans discriminated against Jews.

"I don't know of any states that allow PAs to practice independently. Supervision is required, and at least in California I know that a PA can't open a practice and hire a supervising physician.

However, supervision doesn't mean direct supervision. After hiring and training, a PA would be seeing patients as their provider. The point of the supervising physician is to have someone to run things by if you have any questions or concerns. In California, the supervision physician doesn't need to be on site, only available by electronic device.

I've won 4/5 years. Found out pretty early that I'm somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. I do outline, but it's bare bones. Instead of deciding what point A and point B are, and how to get there, I decide what point A and point G and point S are, and tell myself I'll figure out how to get there in November. 

I do this because I know how I write, I know that some of the plot needs to be decided organically, i.e. while I'm writing, and some points need to be set in stone before November 1st happens.

So if the question is whether people in *groups* are swayed by facts, I'll agree that it's harder to sway their opinion using facts. Ideologies held in groups tend to be held together by trust in a group more than they trust a foreign group's data.  They're also grounded in loyalty towards their group.  Deviating from the agenda is more than just going with facts.  It is still not impossible, but it does compete against other things.

"I'm not disagreeing that communism is when there is a classless society.  I'm telling you that your understanding of what a ""classless society"" is has been riddled with the ideological dominance of the ruling class.

There's nothing conspiratorial about it.  One doesn't need a conspiracy to know that media and press have been dominated by those with the means to afford media and press and that they will, of course, write favorably of themselves.

Thankfully, we've reached a stage of technological development where that level of control is now in decline.

If you're actually interested in what communism is instead of just parroting what you've read on howstuffworks.com, I suggest you read the writings of communist authors.

If you want a relatively short work which addresses specifically the distinction between communism as defined by the modern founder of communism, Karl Marx, and the nature of the USSR, I suggest the following:

"&gt; And this somewhat falls under the same category as ""remixing"", at least for me. You say that putting a new drum sample under one of his songs isn't really remixing, but at the same time, it's almost the same Nujabes did for his songs. Take a look at 'Lady Brown' for example. It seriously is just 2 samples (from the same original song) slightly sped up, with Hats, Drums and Kicks, looped with some variety (excluding the vocals of course). Give me 2 days and I'd be able to produce almost the same (again excluding vocals, because eh, I don't sound like Cise).

I really disagree with you there. For tracks like these that seem simple, a lot of work goes into vinyl digging, picking separate percussion that fit, recording vocals and so on. He did LOADS more work than just slapping a generic drum sample on a sample, even with simpler tracks like Lady Brown. Of course you can reproduce a track if you know what went went into it but that proves absolutely nothing &amp; I can assure you all of his tracks contain way more work than the remixes I am referring to. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; So as far as profiting from others work, Nujabes did basically the same. Of course he made many songs from scratch, but also many from samples. And I don't think he asked Pat Metheny to use the sample he used in 'A Day by Atmosphere Supreme'. That's just how it is these days. And as long as you are not world famous, no one will care.

I think you completely misunderstood me as I don't mean to imply that sampling is wrong, it can be done wrong and right (just like remixes), but being lazy with it and not adding enough of your own work is doing it wrong.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Addressing your mix, in all honesty, I think you are being a bit hypocritical. No one who listens to your channel is going to sit in front of their monitor for a whole hour and look at the visuals. 

Why would people need to actively look at the visuals for an hour for it to matter? 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; So as far as profiting from others work, you fall under the same category as the people you mentioned. Yeah, you added the intro, arranged it to sound like a mix and all that stuff, and I do think that takes a lot of work, in fact I wouldn't be able to do the visuals myself at all, but you are using his work to gain views (it's your most viewed video by far) and most likely profit from it. 

I think it's unfair to compare us to the channels I mention. They take Feather, a song with 20 million views (with an Ed Sheeran track being their previous upload, super relevant), reupload it which takes 5 minutes and don't have permission to do so. Now I'd even be ok with it as long as they aren't just reuploading big tracks from channels like MrSuicidesheep or are in contact with the artists, but they aren't. 

&amp;nbsp;

The problem is using material to get viewers without regard for the original content. Wanting to get views is kind of the main point of YouTube so saying that is wrong would be weird, but whoring for views is. Also, our most viewed video has twice the views of the mix. Even then, it took us 3 years to upload anything by Nujabes even though he's probably more relevant to our music than any other artist.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Adding visuals doesn't make it your work, at least that's what I think about it, because I don't listen to music on youtube for the visuals, but for the music.

You're leaving out a lot of info I mentioned like the mixing, selection of tracks &amp; getting consent from involved people, which is important in my opinion. 

The bottom line is that I'm ok with people using his work or name, but at least put in some effort to do it in a respectful way. When you remix a track, at least put in a few hours of work to actually contribute to the end track. If you upload a track, spend some time to get permission or find a track that doesn't already have more than 20 million views (there are plenty of more unknown Nujabes tracks out there that are pretty awesome). 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I guess we would know better, if he was still alive.

Sadly that's the truth.

"My doctors rule is that if I haven't kept down food or water for 24 hours, I have to come in and get IV fluids/glucose. 

This meant I was coming in every other or every 2 days up until 20 weeks. I lost count how many times I've been in the hospital.

That said, just keep eating. I tried every food in existence and nothing was a magic fix. The ensure/protein shakes are a good idea. I kept up with those everyday. Even if you puke after every meal like I did, something must be staying down- a bite or two. And so keep trying to eat, keep snacking. 

I took spoonfuls of peanut butter/almond butter every time I went in the kitchen. Sips of milk frequently. Bites of cottage cheese or cheese sticks. Handfuls of nuts, black olives or dates. I kept a box of homemade clif bars by the bed and would eat one every morning before getting out of bed. 

I lost 65 pounds this pregnancy (I was overweight to start and I'm still puking at almost 36 weeks). Babies are great parasites and my little one is perfectly healthy and measuring right on track. Try not to stress too much. I freaked out and cried about how I was killing my child (not to mention wasting money) but I've had a few extra ultrasounds to make sure she's okay and everyone comments how great she looks and how active she is. Your little one will be fine too. Just eat what you can and force yourself to keep it up!

"Honestly, it's mostly about your attitude and habits surrounding food. Yes, I love a lot of high-calorie fatty junk food. Does that mean I need to eat it? No. The way I see it, I have already tasted delicious cheesy pizza, chocolate cake, french fries, etc. I know how it tastes. I don't need to eat it again anytime soon. It's really changing how you think about food. I used to be a binge eater though I've never been overweight. Now, I have stopped binging entirely, and it's due to changing the way I see food.So when I crave something, I just act as if the craving is an annoying fly buzzing around me and mentally swat it away and get on with my day. I find that by spending more time thinking about food and acknowledging the cravings, I'm only making them a bigger issue than it is. So now I'm used to just mentally refocusing my attention elsewhere. I also just tell myself, I can always eat it later. I realized that the foods I want to eat, they will still be there even if I wait until tomorrow or next week or next month. It's not like all the pizza in the world is going to suddenly stop existing overnight. Over time, I got better and better at putting off eating the pizza or whatever until later to the point that it became a habit, I did it automatically everytime I saw something super yummy but not within my calories, and found that I didn't really want it that badly after all. My life still went on perfectly fine without eating whatever the food was. I still eat unhealthy foods occasionally but after changing my attitude, I found that I rarely ever have cravings anymore.

Most of my meals consist of protein + vegetables. My carb intake varies (somedays I don't eat any, some days I eat a lot) and I almost never drink my calories (the only exception is once every month or two if I'm having alcohol or bubble tea while out with friends). I also tend to limit how much processed foods I eat. If I know I'm eating out, I generally eat less before or even skip a meal. Sometimes I skip the meal after as well.

Here's what my day looks like:

Wake up around 7-8am. Drink 2 glasses of water.

Breakfast is usually late, anywhere between 9-11am. I'm not hungry immediately after waking up and tend to eat little for breakfast. It's usually 1 egg and salad, no dressing.

Lunch is usually meat + vegetables anytime between 12:30-3:30pm

Dinner is also meat + vegetables anytime between 5-8pm

Between meals I might have a snack, a piece of fruit or granola bar or a hardboiled egg.

"In my experience yes, for the most part. I can think of a couple instances where I or one of my friends would break off from the group to dance with a guy and most of the time that happened it was someone they knew and ran into at the bar. I think it's a difficult situation to approach the girl in. The circle of girls conveys that they are there to dance with their friends and don't want to be bothered. It's hard to ask a girl if she wants to dance in that situation because you can hardly get near her and the music is super loud and you might get an accidental elbow in the face. But if you just go up and start dancing without asking first then you are a first-rate creep and you will be told off. 

Sometimes when I'm dancing with my girlfriends they will see guys they think are cute or are one of the other girl's type and suggest they go dance with said guy.

The next several ingredients are all corn and or wheat, with little to no water. The ingredients are submitted to the panel pre cooking weights and not post.

Vets often get visited by pet food reps and told tales of the greatness of whatever product the rep is selling. Unless that vet had the time and interest to check the facts for them self, they just go with what the rep says. Unless you are talking to a vet who specializes in nutrition and has done the extra schooling, they aren't much better than reciting what the info sheets written by the food manufacturer claim.

Außerdem, warum erlauben wir es, dass überall, vor allem auch in Sozialen Fragen, neolieberale Logik angewendet wird?

Edit:
&gt;Wieso sollten sie im Verhältnis zu den Leistungen, die sue aus dem Sozialsystem beziehen können, deutlich überoproportional belastet werden? Siehe GG: Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz.

""Gleichheit vor dem Gesetz"" bedeutet in diesem zusammenhang das genaue Gegenteil von dem was du meinst. Wie viel jeder zu leisten hat liegt explizit nicht daran, wie viel er aus unserem Sozialsystem bezieht, sondern, dass jeder relativ zu seinen Möglichkeiten gleich viel beiträgt. Und dass ein normaler Arbeitnehmer 50% seines Einkommens beiträgt und einer der von Kapitalerträgen lebt nur 25% seines **Gewinns** ist wohl gerecht?

Edit 2:

Ergänzung zur Neolieberalen Logik: ""Ein Arbeitsloser oder Geringverdiener ist an seiner Situtaion selbst Schuld. Er hätte sich in der Schule besser anstrengen sollen oder er müsste nur arbeiten wollen.""

Diese Logik vernachlässigt zum einen, dass die Bildungschancen **entscheident** von den Eltern abhängen. Kinder aus ""Harz 4 Familien"" oder Migrantenfamilien haben es schwerer als Kinder aus Akademikerhaushalten. Diese Ungleichheit auszugleichen verfehlt die Politik seid langem. Daher sind viele gering Qualifizierte nicht komplett selbst an der geringen Bildung Schuld. Zum anderen, wie ich schon gesagt habe, gibt es nichtmehr für jeden, vor allem wenn gering Qualifiziert, einen Arbeitsplatz. Viel wichtiger dabei ist als die schon von mir genannte Globalisierung die Automatisierung dieser ""einfachen Jobs"".

Die Popularität dieser Neolieberalen Sichtweise auf dieses Thema erkläre ich mir dadurch dass es einfacher ist zu sagen: ""Kuck, die sind an ihrem Schicksal selbst Schuld! Würden die nur wollen dann könnten die doch auch..."".

Das Problem ist großflächiger und tiefergehen und es ist sehr viel Schwerer nicht diese Logik anzuwenden und Verantwortung zu übernehemen und etwas daran zu ändern zu versuchen.",false,false,t1_cuao4d2,Aapsis,Ach hier kann ich was reinschreiben?,0,1440166954,t5_22i0,t3_3hu6dd,t1_cuam1ev,3,1441384528,0,0,cuao4d2,de,3,,FRNK

"/r/TFABChartStalkers is a good place if you don't get a lot of answers here.   

Your O date may vary from cycle to cycle. There's nothing inherently wrong with that.  It's neither good nor bad.   

My husband and I BD like crazy in the follicular phase and during our fertile week an then only a few times in the luteal phase. I've never heard that having sex after your fertile window will do anything to increase your chances of conception? The rule of thumb is to hit O-3, O-2, O-1, O, and O+1.  So I'm not sure what the reasoning was for your doctor to suggest 2-3 times a week all month long?   

I also don't get EWCM and the amount of watery CM I get is very scant. I've never used Preseed but I'm using it this cycle. My plan is to use it during every BD in the fertile window.  I'm not sure how other people use it, though.  

Good luck!!

"You need an enormous cash investment for 70-75 crafting (in OP's case).

You can craft around 2000 air bstaves per hour (2k bstaves + air orbs), meaning you have to wait 4 hours before you buy another 2k. That's xp waste by definition. That's a 19 mill investment for one hour's experience, which is absurd. 70-75 crafting is 33m investment with air orbs + bstaves if you want non-stop xp. 

Yes you sell back the air bstaves, but that's not the point. 

In the time you wait to buy more bstaffs (assuming you're only doing bstaffs), you could get 75 with d'hide bodies. This is very simple to understand. I did 68-75 crafting with bodies. Many people don't have the enormous cash to train crafting non-stop like that, so it makes sense to do d'hide bodies with no timers on GE.

D'hide bodies are even cheaper xp if you buy the hides and tan them. But hey, you need an enormous investment for bstaves too, so why not.

When I did d'hide bodies just a month ago, it was considerably cheaper xp than bstaves.

If you want to do bstaves, go ahead. But you need to beware of the enormous initial costs first.

"&gt; Black people do not perpetuate stereotypes more so than any other race in America. However, a black person is more likely to represent their culture in the eyes of white people because they are the minority. For example, there are a lot of school shooters and crazy fucks who do evil things that are white, but we don't go saying ""Those white people need to fix their craziness."" Instead we address each case as an individual. Many unarmed black people die at the hands of different cops and we instead say the black community needs to fix their problems of whatever issue, but the cop, who was white, is possibly one bad apple. Does not reflect the whole crowd.


I think your first part is a essentially 'whataboutism'. ""What about X race, they are stereotyped too"". That very well may be true, but black people stereotype is far worse and self inflicting. The CMV isn't on X race, it's black people. 


&gt; ""Those white people need to fix their craziness."" 


We actually do, prior to 'Straight out of compton"" movie. Blacks on social media were posting how whites shoot up theaters but S.O.C. gets beefed up security. 


&gt; Black people want fair representation in media because often they and many other minorities are made to look like jokes. Look up minstrel shows, look at movies back in the day


No, we want power. There is blatant pandering in Hollywood for more minorities to be cast in roles that are suited for another actor. Look at Heimdall in Thor. While we also want to keep CW or BET shows 95% black with a dash of Hispanic. 


&gt; Black people care about education and they care about bettering themselves. 

Not all black people devalue education, but it's definitely not pushed

I did.

&gt; This is pretty much being confirmed here.. but it just seemed strange to me because it seems like it leaves so much room for error. Too much interpolation and readings from stations too far away.

And your instructor should've mentioned that the error was negligible if done right, or, you should've asked him at least. I was at your point in training well over a decade ago and I remember well that for my very first XC while my instructor walking me through flight planning covered this, and I was just as skeptical as you and I asked him about it and he reassured me it was a non-issue.

"Oh geez, I'd say you are about as bad off as me. My medication so far controls convulsive seizures completely, has some control over two other kinds of seizures, and is not effective at all at another type. To be honest, I'm just glad it's been controlling the convulsive seizures...the rest aren't fun since one of the other kinds includes me blacking out, but still more deal-able. The only thing limited for me is alcohol and I'm not supposed to have dairy within an hour of my medication due to one pill being weird with it. You would be shocked how uninformed people are about epilepsy as well, so yet another reason to keep my mouth shut. I just figure only those who would be out and about with me need to know and well my wallet contains info on my name, emergency contacts, doctor info, medication info, hospital to send me to, etc just in case I have any ""bigger"" (lack of a better word) type of seizure.

Also doesn't help knowing if some people have a bad day, they can go and have a couple drinks and feel better. Then I get jealous until I can start getting the logic part of my brain to deal with the illogical about the fact getting drunk is not something that sounds appealing to me.

Also, you might want to work on the proportions of the legs / clarify their design as a 3D artist would have to know exactly what they should look like.  The right model seems to be closer in correct proportion whereas the left model seems to have shorter legs; it's hard to see exactly where the knees are at and the definition of the feet is too loose. Also, good usage of rim light with the red but I think you can do better using the other light source to make the model pop more.

My summoner name is stefke001 http://eune.op.gg/summoner/userName=stefke001

Im currently Silver III ( got here from Bronze V this season ) and im kind of struggling to get to gold which is my goal.

Maybe i could push lane more and roam but that was impossible since Shyvana bullied me hard. Also i failed in last teamfight.

1. What should i've been doing in teamfight in this situation, peeling or diving ?
2. Was i itemizing properly ?
3. How i could get pressure of my lanes ? They were pressuring us from everywhere.
4. Maybe i could build Fizz ap ?

"Lots of good advice here,  but I can see it backfiring. Parents get in this ""power"" mindset- they scold the children, not the other way around. So you CAN tell them that their comments are causing you pain and encouraging an ED, but their first reaction could easily be to get defensive or to laugh you off some more. Emotionally prepare yourself for that.


I wish the answer for you was simply ""get out"", but you're still young and no one here knows how you are financially. 


Whether or not they listen to you, you're going to have to put your foot down. Something along the lines of, ""Do not make comments on my food choices! You do more harm than good"". And keep saying it. Each and every time. The same reaction- ""Do not make comments on my food choices! You do more harm than good"". Make strong eye contact while saying it. Over and over again. They might be irritated for it, or huffy. Expect them to get on your back about being rude to your elders, or some power-crap like that. But keep saying it each time. And it has to be the same words. The purpose of sounding like a broken record is to annoy your parents enough to not want to nag any more. Re-conditioning, basically.

"I made it to the gym late Monday afternoon, much later then usual and I was greeted by the post-office crowed. This was the most people I've ever seen in the gym, everyone was fighting for the only two squat racks. 

I was planning on doing some squats and deadlifts if the squat rack opened up, but for the meantime I just continued my chest/arm workout. Then this couple shows up and starts squating. I wondered around the gym for a because it looked like the dude in the other squat rack was about finished, but as soon as he walked away the couple takes both racks. 

We only have two fucking racks, but whatever, they'er only doing squats. How many sets are they gonna do? So I waited it out doing some more chest and arms. 

Then I notice this bitch uses the fucking rack as a damn seat since she hasn't done anything for twenty minuets.

"My reason for asking this was that as a kid during the attitude era, I remember a lot of title matches in regular shows and any title match in Raw/SmackDown seemed like a very likely opportunity for the title to change hands which kept things interesting. But nowadays, title matches rarely happen and even the minor titles almost always change only during PPVs which makes it a bit sad. I mean, Neville had a WWEWHC title match last week and despite putting on a hell of a show none of us believed that he would win it. The results of John Cena's open title challenges remain a foregone conclusion (even if you discount LOLCENAWINS). 

Wouldn't it be better if someone lost the title(s) at Raw/Smack Down at least once in 4-5 months just to keep the viewers interested? I know wwe needs to build up a feud towards a PPV for eyeballs but why not try something like a champ losing in the 2nd week of the 5 week build up to a PPV and have the feud about them trying to regain it through rematch or something?

"Thanks!  I plan to contact some teacher as soon as I get their info.  I actually tried to do this before I even accepted the position but with no luck. 

I ran into the problem of buying books too.  It would be close to $2000 for one year access to the McGraw series for 6 grade levels.  I wonder, is there anything out there that is free and might be designed for new programs?  

I'm also interested in any resource that might concisely lay out skill level appropriate for each grade level.  Like I said, because I'm new to this I'm not sure what to expect and what to expect of my students.  I know I'll learn a lot as I go, but I'd like to be as prepared as possible going into day 1!

"Smith and Lawson are pretty different situations. Lawson will get a 15 game suspension probably which is fair. Also I would check the facts before trying to claim assumptions as them. He has 2 DUIs as common knowledge. A incident of underage drinking (Not a DUI, he was legally sober just underage). 

Then there's a random 3rd one no one knows anything about outside of Lawson said he had one. So it's 3 max. Not like it makes a huge difference, but check facts before posting a topic. 

Smith was also let off the hook twice for DUIs. Another for the LAX incident. A hit and run. A weapons charge. That's just off the top of my head. 

While both are idiots it's clear one is further along the idiocy path. Smith may never play in the NFL again if he can't clean his act up.

I think physics is a great undergrad to come from for finance work, but it might take a 1-2 year grad program in something like math/finance to really set you up.  You are probably better qualified for a lot of finance jobs than people coming out of business schools honestly, but you probably don't have their network so it can be tough to crack into the highly desirable fields (asset mgmt. and S&amp;T especially).  

Definitely apply though and best of luck.  In Canada internships aren't necessarily for students during the summer so it's possible to get one coming out of school.  I'm not sure if that's the case in the U.K. but if so, apply for those as well.

"&gt;&gt;Please don't accuse me of lying. I may be incorrect but I am not lying.

This was probably the most humble statement I have seen on reddit. I hope the Creator guides us on truth. My apologies.

&gt;&gt;The Gospels and Paul all give us unanimous oral tradition that Jesus died. Paul met the Twelve and they all proclaimed that Jesus had been crucified. 

I want to how you establish this since all we have are letters attributed to Paul. We are not sure if later editors redacted them or not, we do not know really how much Paul the human contributed to these letters.


&gt;&gt; Islam under the same scrutiny, under which it will not fare well.

Oh I do the same. Believe me I am well aware of IQSA, Fred Donner, Revisionism, etc. I am just as consistent in my scrutiny. One of my favorite scholars who is immersed in the western academic sphere is Dr. Joseph Lumbard, I believe Yale PhD. 

If you read people like Gabriel Reynold Syed - usually you can reduce their argument to nothing more than speculation as to ""what could have occurred"" because orientalist start off with the paradigm it did not happen. 

When I look at christianity, the only thing I look at is simple - do we have authentic content from the alleged persons that they were attributed to.

You keep linking Paul and the Twelve but to be frank we do not know if this is later revision to elevate Paul to the Twelve. Someone had the audacity to forge a letter in Peter's name (2nd Peter) to elevate Paul's position.

Furthermore, we do not have enough data. The inauthenticity of the text compounded with lack of direct eyewitness testimony is enough for me to not find the source texts reliable or truthful. In addition you have christian scribes fabricating deeds and sayings and putting them in Jesus's lips which we do not have any means of authenticating (other koine gree) statements to Galilean Aramaic.

I am just curious why do you think God created Islam and allowed it flourish. 

I mean look the reverence Islam gives the Messaih Jesus and his mother Mary. Furthermore, look at how elevated all the prophets are as well as the basic theology Worship the Creator (through commandments which are morally good), so that on the Day of Judgement you may hopefully receive Grace from God (although even if you don't submit there maybe a chance you receive Grace).

Look at how well God preserved the Islamic tradition. Look at how long and continuous the strands have been with plenty of eyewitness testimony.

I am sure you are aware of the lastest Qur'anic manuscript finds and why they ALWAYS confirm to the authentictiy of the Glorious Qur'an.

Just answer me a simple question - after you read the Holy Qu'ran's translation tell me why would God create a religion - a continuation from Adam that teaches to worship God alone in addition to the coming of the day of judgement.

I look forward to your response /u/Afinkel

"&gt;The Tea Party seems like it would do well as a separate party from the republicans and Bernie Sanders could create a Liberal party separate from the Democratics and increase the voting spectrum in the US.

The reality is as soon as a party like this would begin to gain traction, the mainstream parties will modify their platforms to capture that portion of the people willing to jump to a new party.

Our voting system inherently leads to a two party system, as it is winner take all and requires people to choose between two viable options, as voting for a third party creates a ""spoiler effect"".

We would need to fundamentally change our voting system to allow a viable third party to exist. 

Third parties have come and gone in the past, in fact the Republican party was originally a third party.

"&gt; This negates the need to turn sensitivity up well beyond what is comfortable for you, just to facilitate faster turnarounds (a serious issue in almost every console FPS).

For me, it was the other way around. Initially, I used dual stick and when I switched to motion control, my brain was getting confused and still trying to use the right stick to aim. By having the sensitivity at +5, the stick would move too much for aiming and the problem quickly fixed itself. Since then, I've always use the highest sensitivity and it is lowering it that feels uncomfortable. Having such a high sensitivity setting makes it hard to use Y-repositioning because the vertical axis always gets screwed up. This leaves the right sick as the best option since turning with the gyro ends up with the controller awkwardly turned at the screen...

"I know a guy on the ritzy side of town that does the $150 (400 point inspection) on cars. Really depends how nice is the vehicle you are looking at. I have had people take $1200 beater cars to this mechanic. Of course he's not going to recommend a $1200 beater car to anyone and will recommend a full set of service. New timing belt, water pump, new ecm, new spark plugs, all kinds of service totaling way more than the cost of the vehicle itself. And if you were to do all this work, surely any car would last you any years. If all you can afford is a $1200 beater car, then you can't afford to make an old car new again.  Most old cars need new timing belts or major service repairs. Does that mean the old timing belt is going to pop and tear up your valves. Hey it might and it might not. That's the risk you would take by driving a cheap car. As a salesman, I know that people taking a cheap car to get inspected will have some problems and issues that need repair. If you are taking a cheap car for an inspection, you should expect to be making some repairs eventually, or else the car wouldn't be so cheap!

Depending how expensive the car is, I would get the thorough $150 inspection and then take that report to a friend who knows a good deal about cars and talk to him about what is really important and what is not. If the car doesn't have previous service records, than any mechanic will tell you it needs a new timing belt and is a $500 job. Would this make the car, a bad car? No. Would it be worth less than the same car that did have a new timing belt. Yes. 

That extra hundred will always be worthwhile if the inspection is more thorough. With any more thorough inspection, they Will find more things wrong on an old car.

"&gt; That's a subjective term. I thought it was a killer release from a new studio which really did some amazing things, and which easily fit into my Top 10. The people bashing on Gone Home because ""lesbians 10/10 GOTY editor's choice"" are, in my mind, demonstrating the exact same mindset as the people on FreeRepublic forums who think that Twelve Years a Slave only got Oscar nods because of ""white guilt.""

I mean, there is definitely that, and a sense of this push back against progressiveness in gaming. That is completely true (and weird how people started developing a sense of politics that would be at odds with most of gaming anyway). That being said that doesn't negate the flaws of the game and games like it which most definitely do exist, and while it may be an excellent title it is by no means perfect and definitely no a game that does much with it's genre besides developing a unique story.


&gt; I see it as an expansion, not some inexorable push toward games with chest-high walls and people over the radio giving you orders not existing just because Gone Home exists [not that those are the only two types of games out there]. Those games aren't under attack except by people who are sick of them; I don't understand the anxiety.

I need to address this because its an argument I see made a lot. Most people are tired of military cover shooters, this isn't what people with legitimate complaints are annoyed about. Its calling a game perfect when you're just a passive observer in a game you have no control over. The people who aren't obsessive angry conservatives who didn't like Gone Home probably love games like Okami, Gitaroo Man, Killer7 and so on, just a few very unique incredibly artful games that involve the player.

## [Rule 5: Asking for medical or injury advice is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_5._asking_for_medical_or_injury_advice_is_not_allowed)

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.

&gt;Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and ""general experience"" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury.  Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed.  Posts seeking training advice that *excludes* an injured body part are allowed.

&gt;If you would like help identifying or correcting a painful movement, consider posting a [form check]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_2._how_to_post_a_form_check).  
*If you post a form check and there's something wrong with your form; /r/Fitness can help with that. If your form is perfect, there's something wrong with your body and you need to see a doctor*

"The deal with Ursa is that, his damage output doesnot scale well with items. He depends on Fury Swipes and overpower to deal damage. Which means he needs levels more than anything. A few core items like Boots, Blink/Shadowblade etc will do for mid game engagements.

His ability to be the best roshan slayer is a must in my opinion. He needs that one extra trick to stay ahead in the game and be relevant. Once Ursa jumps on someone in a teamfight, you can comfortably kill that one hero and then get kited a lot or get bursted down. Having a aegis every 10 mins makes you force fights and get favourable trades likes this. I think this makes him one dimensional. 

Answering your question:
Let's look at why Icefrog changed the Enrage ability to the new one. This might give us some perspective on what Ursa is supposed to do in Dota. 

 * The old enrage was bascially a damage bonus based on your current health. This forced us to build Strength items on an agility hero, who also needs mobility items + bkb. Still, Ursa could do roshan really fast. He also does insanely high physical damage burst. Made him a good pocket strat. Other than that, he wasn't a good carry ever. 
 
 * The new enrage makes you take less damage for 4 secs every 50 secs. It also is a damage boost ability making fury swipes do double the damage on each hit. He is meant to jump in, tank spells while killing someone right off the bat. Without the strength items that you were previously building on Ursa, he is much more squishier now. To compensate for that, he was given an innate tankability skill. 

 * i believe there are only three spells that can mitigate damage from spell immunity piercing pure damge spells like sonic wave and laguna blade(I could be wrong). Spectre's Dispersion, Centaur Warrunner's Stampede with Aghs and Ursa's Enrage. 

 * Enrage is a good spell against heavy bursts. But the short duration and long cooldown makes it really weak counter to those bursts. Like blademail, they can just wait out the enrage duration before using the spells on you. 

 * On paper, Enrage is the best spell to deal with Laguna blade and Sonic wave. But the rest of the kit of Ursa happens to be really weak against Lina and QOP. Making him a weak counter i believe. Euls, glimmer, Solar crest, Ghost scepter, Stuns, everything hinders Ursa. It is also easy to stop an Ursa from snowballing, if you stop his rosh attempts.

"I forgot to add that I have an 80C thermostat installed. The cooling system should be able to keep the temp below 80C at all times if not for the thermostat restricting the system to keep it at the proper temp of 80C.

Edit: Huh, I could just remove the radiator and flush it out/inspect. I should have done that before posting. :(

Update: I pulled the radiator and flush showed flow through it was fine. However, I think bugs clogged the condenser and radiator. The condenser is still in the car, and I have to roll the car out of the garage to clean it still. But I don't think any of this explain the leak from the top radiator hose where it attaches to the radiator.

Am I on the right track? Should I buy a new radiator or keep the old one?

Final update: Temps went down another 5C with the exterior cleaning of radiator and condenser. I conclude that by design this particular Mercedes, built for one year only and superseded by the E430 with its electric radiator cooling fan, simply has inadequate cooling capacity. I fault the meager fan shroud and the fact that the radiator fan is mechanically driven.

You keep attacking the party here, which shockingly does nothing for you, and just adds to the point that you have created a political bias. Just look at the facts. Forget about which party said what they would do, and what the other will do.

You have been removed from the FTTP roll out because you are in an area that was not far enough in an FTTP build to be worth continuing into FTTP. Likely a lot of work has been done, but can still be used for FTTN (Fibre is fibre, regardless if its a node with 300+ ports, or a node with 4 ports).

Likely the case is because you haven't had a full Node roll out in your area yet. Just very initial part of the roll out.

You said you were on very bad copper. FTTN wont work then, especially since its 1km+. They will likely need to replace the copper, or better, add a new node closer to the premises. This will do a lot for all the premises around you and for NBNco (profits). 

Also, if this is true, that you are 1km away from the node then, you will be the first ever premises that has confirmed that it is ~1km away from the node.

"Username mentions still work.

Also, people shouldn't downvote you even if they disagree. That's not conducive to dialog. I'm definitely not downvoting you.

&gt; You see, the problem with morality arguments and high ground is that the essence of their argument is ""disagreeing with me is treason against...?""

Didn't you make normative arguments too? For example:

&gt; You are allowed to question it, what you aren't allowed to do is hurt others in the process.

What are *you* appealing to there, if not morality? You couldn't argue against people stealing pigs from farmers if you go all the way with moral relativity/moral anti-realism. 

Also, you already conceded the point that we could hurt others my previous post where I used slavery as the example. You said (paraphrasing) that the slave would be hurt more by continuing in slavery than the master would be by being deprived of their slaves — and that was what justified helping slaves escape.  
   
Vegans are applying this exact same principle: the pigs would have been harmed more by remaining and being killed/subjected to farming practices than the farmer would be harmed by having the pigs taken away. You could potentially argue that pigs just aren't morally relevant at all, but this is probably not the best subreddit for that sort of thing. You can assume the vast majority of people here would vehemently disagree.

&gt; The end on slavery was a mutual agreement among humans to protect each other from an undesirable fate.

Please provide a reputable citation that will back this up. I don't think I've ever seen anything compelling claiming slavery was abolished in the US because other white people were afraid of being enslaved.

&gt; That is why, ethically, there is not a good argument against animal agriculture that doesn't directly relate to how it effects human beings.

Not all humans act out of pure self-interest. 

&gt; I believe the ethical argument simply does not stand up for itself. It is a contrived argument based on a contrived system. The environmental argument at least points the finger of morality right at other human beings.

Your argument seems confused. You appear to be simultaneously arguing that morality doesn't exist/is contrived, that we shouldn't do certain morally wrong things and that certain approaches are ineffective. You need to pick an approach and stick to it. You need to *particularly* not pick contradictory approaches.

&gt; And so, in this case, using a fallacy to justify harming another person is not morally positive.

Case in point. You're apparently making a moral argument here immediately after calling morality a contrived system and (I assume) disclaiming it. That makes little sense.

Also, what exactly is the fallacy you're referring to? As far as I can see, you're the only one that has used fallacies as justifications in this thread.",false,false,t1_ctw42vd,Vulpyne,,0,1439058376,t5_2qhpm,t3_3g8p9u,t1_ctw337z,6,1440361045,0,0,ctw42vd,vegan,6,,

"&gt; the tesseract was a fifth dimensional projection of a particular timeline presented for a three dimensional being. It was not all time, as you put it.

True, it's been a while since I've watched it.

&gt;The sarcasm is that perceiving higher dimensions is speculative and you mentioned that to understand the film you should have a understanding of how a fourth/fifth dimensional being would perceive. Which no one does precisely, we can only speculate. You're treating this as far too certain.

Again, true. However, this is science fiction. It's obviously not going to be completely concrete science, some of it will be based on speculative stuff, which is interesting and great if anything.

&gt;Also, the beings in interstellar where fifth dimensional not fourth, so we would want to think about how a fifth dimensional being would see time and gravity, not a fourth as you put it.

I'm not sure where I inferred that they were fourth dimensional beings, I've been saying all along that they are higher dimensional beings.

&gt;To further elaborate, the speculation of how this would all work goes as follows: In the tesseract the photons and gravitons are of same particles except the frequency of the strings inside their quarks, Cooper is able to see the photon and alter with graviton corresponding to that photon. i.e. he can see the situation and control the gravity in that situation. Your description failed to articulate for the fifth dimension.

Great explanation. Thanks.

&gt;Exactly, the answer then is not to call people who are trying to understand the film, idiots. It's a public work, it's open to all criticism. It should be encouraged, not silenced.

You're right. I get worked up sometimes though. My bad. It's partly due to experiences in real life. It's infuriating when some of my friends tell me that Interstellar sucks because of reasons explained in the film.

&gt;didactic

"IMO benzos have horrible recreational potential. There's almost no euphoria and the buzz just feels like a hollowed out version of the alcohol buzz missing a few things (like euphoria).

Re-dosing is also an incredibly bad idea. Just decide how much you're going to take at the beginning of the night, take it all at once, then be satisfied with where that leads you. Because if you try re-dosing to get yourself to the level you want to be at I guarantee you'll end up going too far. Where that black-out dose lies is a hard thing to predict.

Notice though that I'm not saying benzos are horrible, merely that they just have horrible recreational potential. They're great if you're someone like me who has generalized anxiety problems and sometimes needs to chill the fuck out or you need to wind down from a very stressful day. They're also great for getting just one good night's rest when you've been having trouble sleeping lately.

All of that is a quick route to addiction though so I'm very very careful to medicate myself with Etiz only on very rare occasion. If you're looking to have a good time I highly recommend just sticking to alcohol. Benzos got too much baggage. Too little euphoria and too much dis-inhibition.

"H2k is back to early split form, but they still don't seem to understand why they were losing later on. Late Game 2 and Game 3 were prime examples.
 
1. They are an absolute mess in teamfights around objectives. Ryu always looks like he's playing Kassadin and jumps into peoples face instead of respecting opponent adc/mid damage and maintaining distance. He needs to rain damage from the back and let the jungler and support frontline.
2. Odoamne has low lane awareness. He is always helpful in tping into other lanes and joining up to take towers, but alone the problems abound alone. As Rumble and Maokai he is always looking for risky 1v1 fights not considering the position of the jungler. He pushes lane and leaves himself vulnerable. As Fizz he was always challenging the Trundle for no team benefit.

It is frustrating to see their problems unaddressed because of how much they do right. Drafting is never a problem. Lane swaps and map movement, top tier. Lane matchups? Kasing/Hjarnan always pull off some clever trades and Ryu has great map awareness. When are they going to move forward?

"I'm not so sure what Tailwind does for you on this team. Hydreigon is scarfed and already outspeeds most non-scarfed opponents. Aegislash has weakness policy and would prefer to be hit first while in shield form to get the boost without getting knocked out, Amoonguss doesn't have the damage to justify spending a turn on buffing it's speed although fast spore isn't bad, Talonflame has priority on everything but flare blitz and Milotic is really bulky and doesn't really care if it's slow. Sylveon is the only one that to my mind can take advantage of the Tailwind so I'd consider swapping Tailwind out for something like overheat to crush Aegislash (flare blitz is risky cause of king's shield).

I'm personally very wary of double choice items on any team, but bear in mind I only play VGC. If you're into Smogon doubles you'll get to bring all 6 to a match and that means you'll have more opportunities to swap out and change moves making those pokemon less restricted.

Rocky Helmet is my personal preference on Amoonguss to have a better matchup against Kangaskhan among others, not to say that black sludge is bad.

Lastly I do think you should look for a mega evolution. Given the amount of special based pokemon on your team and the presence of milotic (intimidate is less threatening) I'd go with a strong physical threat. Metagross sounds good, but you could also go with Kangaskhan or a physical Salamence (not allowed in Smogon doubles).

Monster Hunter is a game that asks you to think.  The pace of the game is extremely deliberate, monster fights are broken up in such a way that you can really prepare for any given hunt, and there's a *huge* amount of content that you need to sort through to figure out what you ought to be doing next.  The game has dozens of mechanics, almost none of which it explains adequately, so players spend a lot of time looking things up.  The game requires a huge time commitment; most people on this sub have clocked hundreds of hours in MH4U without being done.

If you try to play Monster Hunter like any other action RPG, you're going to find it extremely difficult.  MH doesn't play like other action RPGs.  If you just swing wildly, you're going to cart.  Repeatedly.  There is no leveling mechanic for your character, just upgrading your gear incrementally.  MH encourages you to grow *as a player* more than it encourages your character to grow in power.  As you fight monsters over and over, you'll find yourself getting worlds better, taking fewer hits and doing more damage, even without your gear changing.

Again, I'm completely fine with people arguing for the fiction of the Bible.  It is, in part, why I put no trust in its purported accuracy.

Well no, not particularly, since that would be far off the topic of the OP's question.

Death Knights were the melee, frontline empowered servants of the Lich King, and thus you'd want and need races that have this warrior culture and physique to take on these decaying, dark knightly shapes and forms. 

Not abysmal pink-haired midgets that are there for comic relief and other deviant races. There are other sentient, undead states and roles to fulfill, lorewise only specific beings which met the requirements both in physique and capability should've been made into fully plated, champions of death and decay. 

Those who did not meet such could've been made into Necromancers or fulfill some other useful role in terms of more elitistic lore.

The only reason Blizzard is avoiding multiple races for Demon Hunters is to save work effort on animations and models for the different demonic forms, this time they hide behind lore.

They didn't with WotLK, they acknowledged that for the sake of fun and the playerbase, allow most races to be made Death Knights.

"Test out different things at the beginning of the year. Everyone studies differently, so you will have to figure out a way that best suits you. For example, try to study while listening to music. If you get too distracted, don't use the music again. Another example, try to study in a room where there is little to no entertainment. I have found that studying in my dining room is great because there is no computer in there, and I'll sometimes leave my phone in another room. You could also study on your bed, but that can make you sleepy because your brain thinks bed = sleepy time.
Another thing you can do is get everything you would have to do later out the way, like emptying the garbage bins. But, make sure it is only necessary things. Going on TV tropes is something you can do after your test/exam. Tell your family you need your quiet time to study, and make sure that you will be able to study without any interruptions. When you get confident that you know the material you are studying well, you can ask family/friends to quiz you, and you will be surprised how much it will help you remember things for the big day.

Not everything works for everyone, but I hope I was able to provide some decent advice. Good luck this year!

Though it may only have minor effects on overall inflammatory cell numbers, that doesn't mean that it does not impair the immune response. Above, it is stating that the numbers are comparable, but the cell function is reduced. 

An analogy would be if you had two football teams playing (one team your inflammatory cells and the other the pathogens). Without vaping, you get a professional team that are good at what they do; conversely, with vaping, you are instead stuck with a high school football team. The pathogen team are pros either way.

The numbers would still be comparable, whichever team you chose, but they would not be operating at the same level. So who would you rather have, the high school players or the pros when you are betting on the game. 


Which is also not to say that all the numbers line up either. From the study, ""E-cig exposure increased neutrophilic inflammation at day 8 after virus infection, compared to air exposure, but decreased Th1 and Th17 cytokine levels.""

Increased inflammation essentially means that your body is needing to call in reinforcements to deal with the infection because it is getting high-schoolers instead of pros. Additionally, Th cells are what we call t-cells, which are needed to fight infections, and among the cell types are some of the best at their job.

The next reason you gave was about marvel hijinks. Ummm that's all on the writers and artists of the book. Star Wars has had comic book stories (and some actually are even better than the movies), and there has been marvel stories better than Star Wars.

"Police, like everyone else, have the right to self-defense when they have a *reasonable* fear. This is from the [Cincinnati PD patrol manual](http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/police/assets/File/Procedures/12550.pdf):
&gt;  **Police officers may not use deadly force merely to prevent escape in misdemeanor
cases.** The use of deadly force to prevent escape of felony suspects is constitutionally
unreasonable except where the escape presents an immediate risk of death or serious
physical harm to another.

&gt;Where the suspect poses no immediate threat of death or serious physical harm to
others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of
deadly force to do so. If an officer uses unnecessary and/or excessive force, or acts
wantonly and maliciously, he could be found guilty of assault, even of culpable
homicide if he kills the person he is attempting to arrest.

&gt;[...] Self-Defense: A police officer is authorized to use that force reasonably necessary to
protect himself or others from death or serious physical harm at the hands of another. 

&gt; There must be an apprehension of **real or immediate danger** based on an overt
and/or constructive act by another

"&gt;Yes, are you? Because I can't believe anyone would actually be insane and brainwashed enough to consider American ""news"" trustworthy.

I never said that, I said that its more trustworthy than a COMEDY show.

&gt;Yes. And the same goes for American ""news"" organizations... with the difference that their job isn't to make you laugh. Their job is to spread propaganda while pretending to be serious and objective.

They do try, within their own narrative.

&gt;Yes. Which makes him more trustworthy. You can trust him more because he isn't trying to hide anything.
To educated and intelligent people it is obvious that news shows are biased, too. They just don't say they are. Which is why they are less trustworthy.
Do you really not understand the meaning of the word trustworthy?

I can trust someone for information when he is overtly biased? Notice the leap in logic there?

&gt;This isn't about watching a comedy show for information. 

Yes actually it is, you should never be watching a comedy show for anything but laughing.

&gt;This is about finding American comedy shows more trustworthy than American ""news"" media. Which is a good thing, because you can't in any way whatsoever trust American news media.

I can't in anyway? Oh brother.

Home Area: West Farthing

Tom is an old, and well to do Hobbit. He is the best tailor in West Farthing, if not the Shire itself, in his own not so humble opinion. Tom's hobbit hole is a small, but well to do affair, with the usual well stocked kitchen, and although it might not be as fancy as that Mr Bilbo's hole, well, we can't all be dashing o'er hill and dale to go traipsing with elves and dwarves. Not to say Mr Bilbo is a trouble maker, no, he's a good man so he is, always had a kind word for dear old Tom.

Tom takes much pride in his gardening, and while he'll be the first to admit he ain't no Gaffer, his garden still earns a few looks every now and then, with its well pruned apple tree, and flowers set in their patterns. He also is a very skilled storyteller, and as soon as Tom takes up his usual stool in the Green Dragon, he'll have a small group gather as he begins relaying off one of his tales, of far off adventures, or some even closer to home. He always knows how to play his audience, and when Mr Bilbo gets overworked by it all, Tom will sometimes step in, and he might well be the cause of some of the wilder tales circling about Baggins.

Tom is single, never having settled down in his life, although he always makes sure to take a big basket of vegetables to his ma and pa.",false,false,t1_ctnfbjd,thesheepshepard,King Thengel of Rohan | Tom Fairbanks,0,1438387470,t5_393pp,t3_3fcpco,t3_3fcpco,6,1440210881,0,0,ctnfbjd,lordoftheringsrp,6,,Rohan

"The spread is just the difference between bid and ask, and will vary between everywhere you look. Banks in Canada are part of a market oligopoly, and so by matching their competition, they are actually acting as a market buffer for the consumer end of things. They will typically post a ""spot price"" rate, which is actually a snapshot of a certain range and not necessarily accurate for the current forex market prices, it's like a nice average price. The spread for currency exchange will be slightly larger, like an extra couple pips (1 pip=$0.0001) on top of the current market spread. The spread is actually the fees everyone is paying, you pay the spread instead of having exchange fees tacked on to the transaction. It's a necessary evil in forex. If you're exchanging cash they will give you the spot price for that minute/hour/day, depending on how volatile it is (for CAD/USD it might be a moving average price, but as an example we saw the CAD/INR fall dramatically you might have noticed they locked in aggressive spread prices or even restrict trading altogether).



Besides this, regardless of intent if you are exchanging cash you won't find a ""favourable"" deal. You'll find everywhere is a similar average to the competitors, and currency booths typically won't offer a better rate than banks do, but you can always find exceptions to any rule. A brokerage account would be the best way to sidestep those spreads, and assuming you aren't gonna be needing that capital anytime soon, leaving the money in the account and waiting for the next rebound would offer even better returns than exchanging in cash and sitting and waiting.

Furthermore, the Guarantee Clause is specifically required to be maintained in the Colorado State Constitution itself.

That's derived from the plaintiffs complaint, and IMO an excellent argument.  SCOTUS does not want to start mucking with reinterpreting the Guarantee clause.

"I think it somewhat depends on the book your reading and the author that wrote it. Unfortunately It doesn't seem to be particularly consistent. 

Their height varies from around 7 to 8 foot, that's pretty consistent amongst most novels and other 40k books, most of the primarchs were much taller (apart from Alpharius). 

As for weight the Relic 'Space Marine' game puts them at around 300 kilos in armour but that would make their armour very lightweight (like 50kg lightweight which conflicts with other sources). The current 'worlds strongest man' competition winner is Brian Shaw at 6ft8in and 197kg. If we say a space marine is around that volume but taller we're looking at 210-250kg although it would definitely seem in the art that they are much bulkier than that.  I would imagine they would be of a slightly higher raw strength level without armour but with much more ability for stamina due to their enhancements. Then you add armour and the various servos and parts therein and you have a very very strong person indeed. Although I'm sure some others can provide more examples of them actually doing some stupidly impressive strength based things. 

They are superhuman but still very much in the realm of physical possibility, so they're not going to be lifting tanks over their heads and battling with them but at their weight they would easily outright snap the spine of a normal human with a strong tackle. When you factor in the weight of their armour... they're not exactly going to be beaten in fist fights by anything other than the stronger kinds of orks, (what they were initially designed to combat) orgryns, or other nasty xenos beasties.

"&gt; Let's say we're running a sim of ""Russia has done a covert invasion of Estonia a la Ukraine"" and you need to get Germany on board to not veto invocation of NATO. And without NATO, you get a card come up on the screen that a lot more American troops are going to die in your planned operation. Going hard line just cost American lives (as it would in real life).

Hmm, that raises an interesting point. Would this help evaluate the candidates equally? Let's say Candidate A is successful in this case in getting Germany to support NATO's involvement. So Candidate A saves X American soldiers, which has to be an extremely fuzzy number.

That same simulation can't be used to evaluate Candidate B, who has to deal with a simulated military coup in a Tin Pot African Republic. The number of civilians saved could be larger in Candidate B's case, even while sacrificing significantly fewer soldiers than Candidate A's simulation. But the numbers don't tell the complete story, and since it's nowhere close to being a controlled sample I can't evaluate whether A is better than B or vice-versa....I don't know how anyone else could either.

"&gt; To clarify, my practical view of an implementation of this is that a responsible guardian would vote on behalf of the child until such a point as the guardian feels the child is suitably mature to make their own decision or the child has reached a certain age.

So you really just want to give parents an extra vote?  What if the mother and the father disagree on the kid's vote?

"Completely behind it and set in her ways. Thankfully the principal and guidance counselor were more liberal and progressive or I likely would have been labeled a deviant and a CPS investigation would have been opened. As this woman even hinted at. 

It ended with me stating that this woman wasn't allowed to interact or even be within 100 feet of my daughter.  She no longer is employed by the school district. She had a few other gems about how all the girls are promiscuous these days and inviting attacks by the ways they dress and so forth. She also cited dozens of studies likely commissioned during the Eisenhower administration. All of her STI information was dated. Most of it wasn't accurate or relevant. It was also heavily gender biased and made 0 mention of male responsibility or 'no means no' type training. 

I refuted every one of her claims. I busted out recent studies. I came prepared! Even cited consumption stats by pornhub. Thanks for the excellent data on your website /u/Katie_Pornhub. :-). 

Then I went to the district and raised hell. It was a pretty surreal experience to find out that my daughters sex Ed in a public school was less progressive in 2015 than I received in the late 80s in a fucking catholic (Jesuit) school. Or that my daughter was indirectly being accused of being something she certainly isn't.  (That is assuming she watches porn, chooses to masturbates or dresses 'provocatively'.  Which is her god given right.  The latter being her right when she is of age, of course!)

Though, in all this, my daughter was the real hero. She had the fortitude and responsibility to bring this issue home and complain about it openly. It says something when a 13 year old can recognize your bullshit and have the courage to call you out on it. Especially with sensitive issues like this. I demanded and received a formal written apology on her behalf from the school district.  No one accuses, directly or indirectly, my daughter of being anything she isn't.

First one is in use, second in storage and third where it would go wrong.

I agree that outriggers/legs is an idea that lacks elegance.

I do think there's something in the idea to shift the centre of gravity just so that you can fit the pillow blocks away from halfway the table and have the short side flip down and the long side up.

Which brings me to the idea of a rectangular rig, where one side lines up with one edge of the table, the other side with the centre of gravity of the table and a third wheel/outrigger folding up when in storage. The same third wheel would sit all the way out to one edge of your cutting table, so the stability when in use is amazing.

The stability when transporting it not so much, though. So it would depend on the floor quality of your workshop how good of an idea that is.

"Average Intelligence, easy to RP.

As for the high Wisdom, it's not the same as Intelligence. Basically she'll naturally just know(to some extent) whether or not something is bad or good to/for her. She'll also be wise in making decisions on who to talk to, what to say though she may not speak it gracefully, what to mess with and what not to, and understand a lot about how creatures carry themselves or function to know whether or not something is a threat or invitation, etc. You'd be fairly perceptive about things too, which lines up fine both the sake of skills and RP.

"Всем желаю здравия! Изображение

В нашей необъятной живёт множество славянских народностей, даже названий которых мы уже почти не помним. Великоросы, малоросы, среброросы, чудь, мери, кривичи, вятичи, самары, киржаки, ижорцы... Благодаря советской номенклатурной системе в виде трудовых командировок и переездов, гонений и высылок малых народов и репрессий непокорных, продразвёрсток и голодоморов- перемешав все народы и забыв своих Предков, мы стали именовать ся прилагательным ""русские"". Чтобы стали все, кто выучил язык, русскими евреями, грузинами, таджиками,,, Делалось это чтобы вывести из памяти славянских народов наши самоназвания и семейные предания, и создать нацию одинаковых советских космополитов- не помнящих родства и своих корней, не понимающих слов Родина и предательство- кому стало неважно где жить и на кого работать- лишь бы было комфортно и сыто. Чтоб меньше думать, вспоминать, искать правду и переживать.

А ведь каждая порода несёт в себе генетические предрасположенности, особенности культуры, речи, облика, и даже пищеварения. Потому решил кратко прояснить явные отличия нас, чалдонов, от обычного ""мирского люда"". Благо оказалось и в нашей деревне тоже есть донцы.

Чалдоны на протяжении сотен веков жили в Сибири замкнутыми общинами, сумев сохранить русский язык в оригинальном исполнении, что позволяет твёрдо их называть народом русского происхождения. Множество устаревших форм звучания русских слов, выпавшие из нашего языка термины, оригинальные обороты и многое другое, даже при беглом ознакомлении с образцами речи чалдонов, говорит о давнем отделении данного народа от основного русскоязычного массива.

По рассказам старожилов чалдоны пришли в Сибирь за 10-15 поколений до Ермака, т.е. не позднее 13-14 веков. Рассказчики передали информацию всего лишь о нескольких родах, сославшись при этом, что пришли они в Сибирь в места, давно уже освоенные другими семьями чалдонов. До этого они жили в черноморских степях в междуречье Дона и Днепра. Там их называли «самарами» и обзывали «паджо».

Чалдоны ушли из причерноморских степей потому что «начались страшенные войны». 

В том, что чалдоны оказали сопротивление казакам русского царя, кроются традиции холодного, пренебрежительного отношения к чалдонам со стороны русских поселенцев. Вновь прибывшие переселенцы встретили в этих местах аборигенов, говорящих на устаревшем («потешном») русском языке, не знающих огнестрельного оружия и многих других достижений тогдашней цивилизации, да к тому же противящихся русской колонизации.

Существенную роль в негативном отношении к русскоязычным аборигенам Сибири сыграли религиозные взгляды. Чалдоны были в основном язычниками, только некоторая часть из них в стародавние времена подверглась христианизации. Но за отсутствием связи с религиозными центрами их христианская вера выродилась, создав некий упрощённый симбиоз язычества с элементами христианства.

Официальная церковь не могла этого допустить, считала язычниками и вероотступниками.

Данные факторы повлияли не только на негативное отношение к чалдонам, но и на замалчивание их заслуг в освоении Сибири. Ни одна летопись, ни один документ Московского царства прямо о раннем чалдонском населении Сибири не говорят.

Чалдоны к Московской Руси не имели никакого отношения, в отличие от казаков Ермака, устюжан, мезенцев и чердынцев.

Всё это доказывает огромное количество прямых и косвенных фактов, а также сведений из дошедших до нас документов: ",false,false,t1_cty7gon,Bajkal_ru_nf,,0,1439230472,t5_2qh53,t3_3ghqio,t3_3ghqio,1,1440397164,0,0,cty7gon,history,1,,

"Order of pedals can really change the tone. Kevin was asked about this in his AMA and said:
&gt;I think a good place to start is to reverse it entirely...!

And for lead parts on Why Won't You Make Up Your Mind and Apocalypse Dreams, Kevin runs his guitar through a Boss BR-600 digital multitrack recorder, and uses the on board pitch shift effect. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMs8-1GqRM4) seems to explain it best.

There are other pitch shift, octave, and synth emulator pedals out there that will get you pretty close, but that's the way Kevin does it.

"&gt; This post is about that ultimate discussion, how do you differentiate from just words, jokes to a state of mind (not after the fact).

Here is a thought experiment. Imagine that we know with 100% certainty who killed Hae (murder caught on camera, numerous eyewitnesses, etc.) What we don't know is whether it was a spur-of-the-moment thing or part of a plan. Let's say we are responsible for presenting relevant information to the finder-of-fact who must determine if the murder was planned. We search the bedroom of the murderer and we find a break-up note from the deceased to the murderer. The note is a plea from the deceased for the murderer to please move on and respect the deceased's decision to end the relationship, and how recent conduct of the murderer has forced the writing of the note, and indicates that by necessity, the break up must be cold and final. 

On the note in the murderer's handwriting are the words ""I am going to kill"", as well as disrespectful comments about the deceased. 

Is this something we should present to the finder-of-fact to help them determine the state of mind of the murderer, and help them determine whether the murder was planned?

&gt;The best recent example of voters rewarding a principled MP was Bill Casey, first elected as a Tory in 1988 in a northwestern Nova Scotia riding.

&gt;Casey is now back on the ballot in Cumberland-Colchester, running this time as a Liberal. Ironically, if there is ever a vote on abortion, Casey will have to vote as his party leader orders — for that is the condition Justin Trudeau laid down for all his candidates — regardless of how Casey or his constituents feel about that difficult moral issue.

&gt;Casey last won a seat because he put voters above party politics. This time, he’s running for a party that will force him to put party above those same voters.

Why is there this notion that Bill Casey is Pro-Life? He voted against Mulroney's abortion bills as a rookie MP in the '80s and agrees with his new party on the Abortion issue. Where is the conflict there?

"**Actual answers post**

&gt;1) Is it still popular? I know the games been out for a few years, and I'm just wondering what the player base is like right now. I heard about the new expansion pack being released, so I'm assuming the population will jump back up to check it out but, aside from that, how many people are really playing it?

It's active. Specific statistics are neither published nor well-known.

&gt;2) How solo-able is this game? I tend to play by myself and I don't mind partying when necessary but I prefer games where I can do a large chunk of it by myself.

You can solo the story, solo the open world ""map completion"" aka ""playing GW2 like Skyrim"" but the game is *designed* to push you into player interactions. If you don't want to play with other people, you'll be missing out on a lot of content.

&gt;3) What makes this game different from other games, that would make me want to spend money on it, versus just playing a different game that's free?

**Your** interests entirely determine the answer to this question. What *exactly* do you enjoy from other MMOs - PvP, dungeons, large ""raid"" content, lore, fashion, etc.?

&gt;4) How friendly is the game towards new players? As in, are new players at a disadvantage because it's geared towards people who have been playing for a while, or is it accessible for new players?

It's got a ""new player experience"" learning curve that slowly introduces new players to all the content. If anything, many even consider GW2 to be ""designed for casuals"" - it lacks a ""gear treadmill"", the endgame content isn't all that great/exclusive, and most content is very accessible to the average player.

People compliment my cakes all the time. Telling me how delicious they are. Telling me it's so much better than box mix cake. Telling me they could never bake a cake so delicious. Well guess what? For $1, they too can make a cake just as delicious. Just add oil, eggs and water. In my defense, I love cake decorating. I make all of the frostings and fondant from scratch. I just hate baking fucking cakes!! I base my prices mostly on the decoration of the cakes and not of the cake itself of that makes sense. Still... No one knows about this except my husband.

"I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with wanting to talk about real things.  I think it's actually because of my upbringing that I very much dislike fluff talk and superficiality of any kind.  I want to dig deep to the REAL issues and make sure we are all on the same page, and thinking critically and sharing in this life and experience and perspective and learning about ourselves and each other.  With that said, there is a time and a place!  One on one with people is a good time to discuss.  At a party, keep it light and fun.  At least, this is how I do it.  So, don't beat yourself up! It's not a problem at all!  There are lots of people who like to talk about global warming!  Most people feel uncomfortable and don't know what to say, so in a group, keep it light.

As far as the other issue of talking about your problems, I've noticed people will dump on me when they really should be talking to their spouse or friend who is giving them all of these headaches.

"When I was also around 10, my best friend and I would sneek out of the church services once the pastor began his message. His mom was the janitor at the church so we had access to basically everywhere in the building.  We would generally just roam around abd talk about videogames. One day my friend says ""hey ericzoltz, there are extra communion crackers in the kitchen. Lets go eat them."" So I said of course we should do that and we snuck into the churches tiny kitchen. On the table was a shiny silver metal dish with a lid in top. We opend it and inside was a single layer of oyster crackers laid out in the dish so they only covered the bottom of the dish and didn't mound up. So we ate them and continued our conversation. 20 minutes later, it was starting to get towards the end of the church service. So we decided to go back to the sanctuary and sit thru the last 5 minutes or so of the service. I put the lid back on the dish and we went and satback down, he with his mom, me with my parents. As the service started to end the pastor announced that they were now going to perform comunion. I look across the room at my friend with a look that said, ""did we just eat all the communion crackers?"" My friend looked back at me and gave me a look that said ""settle down you big pussy"". There were already 2 metal dishes up in front of the pastor, so I figured one had crackers in it. As the pastor was saying we were going to take communion, a lady from the church got up and walked toward the kitchen to get the crackers. The crackers that we ate. I looked back at my friend and he had that ""oh. Shit."" Look on his face. But then I thought ""wait, surely they have a whole bag of crackers somewhere, they can just refill it."" The lady walks back into the sanctuary with the covered dish. Now my friend and I both had the ""oh shit"" face goin on as we watched. The lady set the dish down on the table that was in front of the pastor. The pastor lifted the lids off the 2 dishes that were already on the table. Those dishes held little cups full of grape juice. Then he took the lid off the cracker dish and paused. He looked at the dish, then he looked at the lady who brought it. She jog/walked back over to the pastor and looked at the dish. Then the pastor said something to her and she shook her head. They talked for like 10 more seconds and then the pastor looked up and said that they had no crackers, at all, and that communion would instead be offered during the service that evening. We totally got away with it. Now as an adult I know that it wasnt that big a deal. But as a 10 year old kid, my buddy and I thought we were fucking rebels.

The difference is in that Valve don't decide that Earthshaker must be played as support, and if someone finds a way to be successful when playing Earthshaker mid, that playstyle must be nerfed to the ground or made impossible because it messes with The Meta.

That's the difference.

My biggest concern from reading this is the difference is income. As you obviously know being a graduate student is a full time job. I know for mathematics (what I'm doing) you get an assistantship where you teach 2 or 3 sections of calculus or some other Freshman/Sophomore course as your ""work"" to the college. For compensation, you get like $1000-1500 a month depending on the college, which I imagine is a giant decrease from what you're seeing momentarily. What I'm getting at here is that there might be a change in life style, not knowing your current life style I can't comment on how it will change exactly but be prepared to live on a budget.

"For one, probably have some more trust in the government.  I have noticed that people representing voters all around suck, and most of these people are either A) Too lazy to get up and vote, or B) Don't trust the representative to care about voting for what the people want and already have their vote in mind before it even opens to the polls.

In my county, a rep called my wife (a very involved Assistant Principal) to get her input on re-upping an education fund for schools of arts.  Asked my wife about her thoughts,  talked with her for almost 30 minutes about it, then voted against it.  Come to find out, a new private art school was going in (one of the biggest in the country) and lobbied against re-upping the bill.  She already knew which way she was voting, and was just doing the rounds.  My wife didn't feel like her input mattered.  This school put 7 other arts schools out of business, and THOUSANDS of students weren't able to afford the new one.  So thousands of art students had to go to a public school instead of their art school.  Now everyone knows this new school as pretty uppity and snobby.  It's hard to say that she voted for the greater good.  It boils down to money.  And money talks far louder than voters.  So why vote?

Which makes the sudden twist quite scary. When we eventually develop sentient A.I. we won't be able to trust it.

"Feminism is necessary in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. It is worthless and needs to die in the West. 

You can keep arguing all you want. I've probably put a lot more thought into this opinion than you assume. You aren't going to change my mind. And bitching at me about how I must be a misogynist is only going to make me think you're an imbecile. 

You want a full explanation?

Look at what Third Wave Feminism has done to males in America.

Women have more protections than men here.

Is consent to sex consent to reproduction? For a woman, no. For a man, yes.

If someone claims you raped them will it ruin your life regardless of actuality? For women, no. For men, yes.

If you are due to have a child can you opt out of the responsibility? For women, yes. For men, no.

If you have a divorce can you seek alimony and get paid money for no reason? For women, yes. For men, no.

If you have a divorce with children can you get custody despite making less and being irresponsible? For women, yes. For men, no.

Does your gender keep you out of prison for heinous crimes? For women, yes. For men, no.

Can you work at a daycare without people thinking you're a pedophile? For women, yes. For men, no.

Women DO NOT make less than men for equal work. Rape is not accepted in America as even the claim of it can ruin your life.

Increasing the rights or protections of one demographic does not make equality.

Same as taking rights or protections away from another does not make equality.

Programs like Affirmative Action assure that blacks get jobs, but actively takes jobs from other people.

Criminal courts like to make sure they press hard on sex crimes to protect women, but end up destroying a lot of innocent men's lives in the process.

Allowing women control over their bodies, like through abortion, gives them a right to control their reproduction, but other than abstinence men have no equal right. They can't ""opt out"" of the responsibilities unless someone else adopts their child. Why not? Because the legal system decided to protect women from being stuck as single mothers without support. So child support became a thing and for a man there is no way out of it.

Men work 98% of mining and construction jobs, or something like that. Why? Because women don't apply. Women have been encouraged their whole lives to go ""break the glass ceiling"" at corporate and become a CEO by working in the office and moving from job to job. Then they sacrifice time from their careers to do what? Well, a lot of women have children and leave work to raise them. A lot of women switch careers. They quit their jobs more often. This results in them making less money over their lifetime, and the solution is to pay them for the time they choose to take off? Most jobs don't offer men paternity leave. Why should a woman be able to take more than a month and half off and be paid for her decision? Not only by her job, but by her husband if they divorce. Alimony is supposedly meant for a man to pay a woman for the time she spent out of work doing whatever. My ex-wife chose to sit on her ass the entire time we were married, but if she had sued for alimony she would have gotten it. Why? To pay her for time she chose to not work.

And then look at [what](http://imgur.com/sORvjKv) it [has](http://i.imgur.com/7RVZcYD.jpg) done [to](http://i.imgur.com/7FcH3oW.jpg) the [social](http://i.imgur.com/TJ8PIrN.jpg?1) [norms](http://imgur.com/ZxqVTIR).

Egalitarianism seeks to mend these cracks in the system and protect all demographics equally.

Third Wave Feminism has directly adversely affected this country and continues to be extremely hostile to anyone that attempts to refute it.

There are countless other examples of that the new wave of this movement has done. I'm not going to waste time listing a bunch of them further. 

Anyone that knows me knows I am probably the most equality loving person there is. Everyone is equally neutral until they prove me otherwise. I'm bisexual, I don't care what people's sexuality is. I have a black child, I don't give a shit what color you are. I don't give a shit if you have a vagina or a dick. I don't fucking care. Everyone is equally able to be called an asshole based on their actions, not the definition of a word. Stop clinging to a dictionary to save your sheltered idea of what feminism has become.

Equality is great. Destroying people and denying them equality is not how you achieve it.

- **Expected result:** If you bind kalista item with a champion and want to bind it with other champions your w passive 12% dmg should work with the champion you have binded with. Even if you bind it 100 times over again.

"One thing you can do is start a slow push so when the wave goes to their tower, you have a longer period of time in which to do damage to the tower. It also means you can leave the tower to go and get some wards in their top side jungle. As you said, it's a judgement call. 

There are several situations in which it's beneficial to start a slow push (Where you leave the enemy caster minions alive and kill just the melee minions to unbalance the wave but keep your wave there long enough for the following wave to back it up) - 

1) you know you can dive the enemy laner and you want to push a huge wave into their tower so you can safely dive them. Especially good as Vlad because of his W to avoid a tower shot. 
2) their top laner recalled and you want to get some damage on the tower and/or roam to their top side jungle to deep ward. 
3) you want to set up a TP play while placing pressure on their top laner to stay in lane. 

You should ALWAYS be paying attention to where the members of the enemy team are. If you see the enemy jungler show up mid or bot, know you can start to make something happen with relative impunity top lane. If you see the enemy jungler top, let your bot lane know so they can make something happen - if your jungler is also bot side, it's an automatic 3v2. 

That's all fairly specific to top lane though. Mid lane is fairly similar - if you see your lane opponent leave lane/recall, take the opportunity to push the wave into their tower to deny them as much farm as you can, while allowing you to recall/buy or roam to make a play somewhere else. Mid tower is usually something you push as a team though, because it's quite a dangerous lane to be overextended in. I'd let your jungler know that you're starting a slow push so you can set up a dive or at least scare the other mid laner away.",false,false,t1_ctr93gr,summonerbotone,,0,1438706859,t5_2t9x3,t3_3fri2z,t3_3fri2z,1,1440276926,0,0,ctr93gr,summonerschool,1,,

"Yes. You are insinuating that the death penalty is murder because it is morally wrong, which is the same argument radical animal rights activists use when they say that eating meat is murder. It doesn't make sense because the concept of moral law is flawed in itself, as it changes from person to person. That's why you hear people say that everyone has their own set of morals. If everyone had their own set of laws, it would be anarchy. This is not the case, it doesn't work for ""unlawful"" when referring to the definition of murder, and it is, therefore, unhelpful and misleading.

In the video, the girl claims that she is a ""free inhabitant"". She claims can pick and choose which laws to follow as she wishes, which is, obviously,  absurd. She references the Articles of Confederation, just as you referenced ""moral law"", in order to support her claim.

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;          It’s a wonder anyone would still try to do a classic disaster flick like San Andreas considering almost every action movie that comes out these days already features massive amounts of computer-generated destruction.  With such an emphasis being placed on spectacle in regular movies (as Simon Pegg complained), how could any movie explicitly about the obliteration of a major city hope to stand out?  For San Andreas the answer seemed to be “well, our movie will star The Rock.”
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Now I like The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) as much as the next guy, especially when he’s surprise-officiating weddings, but that’s a big lift even for him.  The guy can’t be on the screen all the time after all, so it seemed inevitable there’d be an interminable action sequence that grew more boring every second longer it went on.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;        Thus it was with some surprise I found San Andreas to be a remarkably immersive and enjoyable experience overall, both when The Rock was around and when he wasn’t.  Don’t get me wrong, this is still a paint-by-numbers plot with all the standard tropes you might expect from a movie like this, but San Andreas has a few things going for it that most other destruction porn sequences don’t.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;Plot&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Raymond &amp;amp;quot;Ray J&amp;amp;quot; Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) is a Los Angeles Fire Department Air Rescue pilot, who saves a girl, Natalie (Morgan Griffin), after her car is stuck on the side of a cliff. In the midst of a divorce from his estranged wife, Emma (Carla Gugino), he calls his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to discuss their upcoming trip to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his colleague Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) are at the Hoover Dam making a breakthrough in earthquake prediction when an unknown fault nearby ruptures, triggering a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that collapses the dam and kills Park in the process when he stays on the dam to save a little girl. When Ray is called into work, Blake reluctantly decides to go with her mother Emma&amp;amp;#39;s new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd), a wealthy real estate developer, to San Francisco where he is completing a downtown high-rise building.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;             Hayes discovers that the San Andreas Fault is starting to shift, causing a massive 9.1 earthquake that starts ripping apart major cities along the fault line. At the same time, Emma is having lunch with Daniel&amp;amp;#39;s sister Susan (Kylie Minogue) when the quake hits Los Angeles, destroying much of the city with Susan among its heavy casualties. Ray is able to save Emma, and they barely escape the city onboard his helicopter. Much of Southern California becomes affected by the quake. In San Francisco, Daniel brings Blake to his office building. Blake waits for Daniel in the lobby, where she meets Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), an engineering student from the United Kingdom seeking employment at the office, and his little brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson). Daniel returns and attempts to leave the office with Blake, but the two become trapped in their car in the parking garage of the building after the string of earthquakes begin to strike the city, partially collapsing the garage. Daniel leaves the car in search of help, but flees in terror, leaving Blake behind. She is found by Ben and Ollie, who help free her from the car and escape the collapsing building. The trio find a working phone line and Blake calls Ray, who begins to fly toward San Francisco with Emma to save her.

             While enroute, the engine in Ray&amp;amp;#39;s helicopter suddenly fails, forcing him to make an emergency crash-landing into a mall below them in Bakersfield, where massive looting is taking place. Among the chaos, Ray steals a Ford F-150 from the parking lot, and the couple resumes their journey on the road, but find they are trapped by the expanding fault line. The couple comes across an older couple broken down on the side of the road. They find out that the older couple own an aeroplane. The older couple agrees to give them the keys to the plane in exchange for their vehicle. Before starting the engine, Ray doubts that he&amp;amp;#39;d be able to save Blake, remembering when he failed to save his other daughter, Malorie, from drowning in a drifting accident. But he is encouraged by Emma to save their only living child, and the couple take off to find her.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Meanwhile, Blake, Ben and Ollie try to find a spot in the city where Ray and Emma can save them; seeing that their planned rendezvous point, Coit Tower, is already engulfed by flames. With help from news reporter Serena (Archie Panjabi), Hayes is able to warn others of a much bigger earthquake in San Francisco, just in time before it hits; becoming the largest earthquake ever in history, recorded as a 9.6.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;           Ray and Emma eventually arrive in San Francisco, abandoning their aircraft and parachuting into AT&amp;amp;amp;T Park just as the aftershocks continue to destroy the city. They commandeer a boat to get around the destroyed downtown only to see that the water in the bay is beginning to recede, indicating that a tsunami is approaching the city. Along with other evacuees with boats of their own, they are able to get over the incoming wave near the Golden Gate Bridge. Daniel, who is on the bridge, is killed when a cargo ship slices the bridge in half and a loose shipping container crushes him. The tsunami floods the city, causing massive casualties and knocking over several buildings. Blake, Ben, and Ollie manage to run into Daniel&amp;amp;#39;s building moments before the water hits. They move up floors and manage to signal Ray and Emma, who are searching nearby for Blake. As they see the trio, the building starts sinking into the ground, causing water to flood the building. Ben and Ollie are able to escape, but Blake becomes trapped in the rising water, runs out of air, and, losing hope, nearly drowns herself before Ray can get to her. Emma crashes the boat through the building&amp;amp;#39;s thick window panes in an attempt to get everyone on board before escaping as the building completely collapses. Now aboard the small boat, Ray performs CPR on Blake and finally revives her after several minutes.
&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The five make it to a relief camp in Marin County. The now reconciled Ray and Emma, along with Blake, Ben, and Ollie, talk about their future as the sun slowly sets on the now destroyed and radically altered geography of the San Francisco Bay Area, now swarmed with different military organizations and rescue vehicles initiating the relief process.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

"This is a topic that I have long approached with interest. I know exactly what the quote for TES fans was referring to, and agree with it and what it implies for this topic. The investment in RPGs on part of the player is such that, outside of the key demographic of these titles (teens to early twenty-somethings) putting in the effort to understand or achieve the ""best"" gameplay or narrative results becomes more burdensome seemingly exponentially. The Persona series is a prime example in my experience. Yes, it could possibly be fun to mix and match the different critters and discover new ones, but when dull combat (in my view) becomes even more dull due to not having optimal gameplay choices, is it preferable to just break the illusion and look up what combos to make? 

Or dialogue choices. Oh, dialogue choices! Which can often have counter-intuitive results, or be so absurdly opaque as to only result in a possible desired outcome through playing the game while trying to balance a guide and a controller (Star Ocean 3 is a perfect example).


Now, how much of this is leftovers from the era when publishers tried to double dip by getting players to buy a guide, how much is bad design, and how much is different expectations and approaches to games on behalf of the audience I don't know, but it might be best to approach this topic as necessitating different considerations based on how different genres or studios (and their design philosophies) approach game design.",false,false,t1_ctr9936,JazzKatCritic,,0,1438707080,t5_2sgq6,t3_3fmmi3,t3_3fmmi3,1,1440276999,0,0,ctr9936,truegaming,1,,

"This is something I've been considering.

1.  ""Trolling"" in a clinical sense, if you will, I'm defining this way:
	1. Persistent identity manipulation, 
	2. intent to inflame masked by relevant content, 
	3. identity and content deception

2. Religious trolling, which doesn't meet those criteria, I'll call *Proslytrolling*.  I don't have a solid set of criteria.  Here's my draft:
	1. Participation w/o relevant content contribution
	2. Frequently insist on the authority of external religious content
	3. Becomes abusive/deceptive when questioned.

Zen Masters don't meet either set of criteria.  Do they play games with persistent identity?  Occasionally.  That isn't enough though, since testing about identity is part of social interaction.  Do people tend to get inflamed by them?  Sure.  But getting inflamed doesn't mean somebody *wants* to inflame you.  While they say that identity and content are not true, they insist that there is no intention to deceive through misinformation.  It's not a fit.

It's tough to make the argument that Zen Masters are proslytrolling as well.  They say there isn't any relevant content.  They say there is no authority.  They are consistently abusive, whether questioned or not, but their abuse isn't patterned.

I've looked around for some study data on proslytrolling because it doesn't fit the trolling model but it seems to be common enough.  Conservatively religious people do it but they also have it done to them by less conservative people.

"Some quick tips. What has been posted so far about general chord and scale knowledge is a great starting point. Once you have that, try and think of how you generally want the tone of your improv to be so that you can set up your important ""anchor"" key changes in advance (even if its just a simple I IV V). You then have a good amount of freedom in how you choose to get through that progression. In the moment of improv you'll often feel the melody pulling you towards certain ideas or patterns you've already played around with in previous practices or jam sessions. You'll want that voice to lead you (and the listener) to the next chord naturally because it will sound better that way. As you come up with more and more of these ideas, you'll have tons of great tools storing up that you can use to fit the moment and take you through the changes you've had in mind. 

Remember that when someone like Keith Jarrett is sitting down and improvising an entire piano concert (!), they aren't just playing and hoping for the best. They have a vast database in their minds of things they can do to promote the idea they think will sound the best in that moment. That database is built up from years of practice and exploration. Knowing from experience what tone a C lydian scale, for example, gives off means that you can insert it in just the right place for that perfect floaty, golden feel. That's why it is so useful to listen to improv masters like Jarrett, Chick Corea, etc. Listen to the atmospheres they set up for just a bar or two using interesting chord voicings, try and recreate that bar on your piano and put it in the toolbox!

Speaking of tone, use chord extensions (maj7, diminished, etc) to set the tone for your melody. You don't even need to use block chords and spell the whole chord out. A great rule of thumb in improv is that the major tones of the chord you are playing over are a great place to fall on when trying to come up with a melody, so you can just choose one or two bass notes in your left hand and spell the rest of the chord out chord out a little with your improvising. Try experimenting with the differences in how defined a chord sounds by leaving out the fifth, or playing two notes a half step away from each other over just the 1 and 5 bass notes. 

Over time you'll get used to the extensions that help promote tension and release in certain situations, which will in turn help you with choosing your rhythm and melodic phrasing. You'll also become eventually familiar with modes, which are certain scale alterations you can choose to use depending on what function the chord is supposed to have. That's more advanced and you won't need it for improv until later, but it'll help greatly expand your toolbox to get that certain atmosphere across just right. Everything you learn helps inform another improvising skill in some way so don't be afraid to jump in and start creating!

I was going to have back surgery the following day and at this point had to plan out bathroom trips AND it was the last day of school. My then 16 yo son comes in my room and said, ""No matter what you do, do not go to the basement. I'll take her to school and come back and 'deal' with it."" The hose had found just the right spot in the siding so the water was streaming through the light fixtures and under the wall in the basement. It had spread half way across the basement and into the carpet and was two to three inches deep. My son  cleaned what he could, with my help and the insurance company had a crew out to finish the job within two hours. The carpet was dried out in a few days but they had to cut out a very large portion of the ceiling and wall to run blowers in so we didn't develop mold.

The last picture -- clearly the reason this Asian woman is wearing a short skirt with heels is to lengthen the appearance of her legs.

"Listen to your doctor's advice if you want, but here's what I reckon you should aim for:

Fasting, 70-100

1 hour post-meal, &lt;140

Any higher than 140 is where damage starts to occur from excessive glucose. 200 is 60 points over that. Fasting sugars should be kept low because even if it's slightly over 100 you're looking at something which is there for a long, long time. This could arguably be doing the same damage long term as huge spikes. If you can get it below even 90 and somewhere in the 80s range that would be very good.

You can even go below 70. I went to 62 once after a 20 hour fast and I did get some symptoms of low blood sugar but only dizziness and headache, although that could have just been lack of energy. You won't get issues with low blood sugar unless it's ridiculously low, like &lt;50 or if it drops really suddenly (I.e reactive hypoglycemia from a huge blood sugar spike).

Low blood sugar isn't a concern for type 2s but it is for type 1s. I advise you to do your own research about blood sugar because the diabetes associations and medical community has standards which are far too lenient. You can listen to doctors if you want but I think you should weigh up all advice here and maybe open your mind to other facts a little. Doctors also recommend a high carb diet to me but I know if I eat lots of bread, pasta and grains like I used to I'll just end up killing myself.",false,false,t1_cuibmeq,ineverwanted,"Prediabetes, 2015, Australia",0,1440737398,t5_2qhsj,t3_3ihfko,t1_cuhd4z0,1,1441543476,0,0,cuibmeq,diabetes,1,,june

"&gt;So anything that involves two teams commpeting is a sport now?

Once again, not my argument. For the third time the argument I've seen put across is many of the elements overlap between the two, I'm not stating my own argument or saying two teams is the only requirement. You seem to be intentionally ignoring this.

&gt;Then what the hell do you call someone who competes at sports.. ?

Irrelevant, my point here was I've never seen someone try call an video game pro an athlete. I don't see what me calling them has to do with anything.

&gt;This would imply that sports are a form of physical exercise. 

And definitions change all the time, I don't see your point. Ever watch old movies?

&gt;I'm sure there are plenty of gamers to defend the movement of their arm and hand, as well as their neck, as physical exercise.

I've never seen someone defend anything as hard as you are defending this. You're in deep.

&gt;I know gamers drink the fuck out of energy drinks, more so than athletes it seems. The energy requirement alone must make it a sport.

"If you don't know about it already, [there's an amazing token creator](http://www.rptools.net/downloadsw/) that will let you turn pretty much anything into neat little tokens. I use it for my World of Darkness campaign and it's amazing. 

Also, I *highly* suggest getting [Rogue Trader Tools](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82650-rogue-trader-generator-tools-released/). This will let you automatically create star systems, artifacts, primitive xenos, ships, and so on. 

Lastly, under Game Settings for roll20, try playing around with the built in character sheets. They help automate a lot of stuff, but are a little tricky to learn. I'm still unsure as to how combat works using the character sheets, but soon™.

 If you do decide to use them, make sure to go over them with your players and let them know how the stuff works. If it boils down to it, use it to have backups of character sheets so you can open them up and whatnot. I've had players lose their character sheets and it's pretty frustrating to not have backups.


Also like others have mentioned, play around with macros. They cut rolling times down tremendously and help automate the more mundane parts of roleplaying games.

"I agree there's a certain licentiousness implied with the dependency o Caleb, and that is troublesome, but from a narrative point it doesn't make sense to have all the girls split from their partners and  get back together with them post time jump.

If I had to pick one Liar that went through the time jump with their partner I'd want it to be Hanna.

"This is pretty late as far as replies go, but I didn't even know that this sub existed. 

I actually discovered the Pomodoro method whilst studying at university. The two things (outside of willpower) that I credit the completion of my degree (which was made all the worse thanks to my ADHD) to was a supportive study partner and adhering strictly to the Pomodoro method. I did 30min on 5 off. I would track my time on my phone and would spend my 5min off walking around and getting my blood pumping. 

Starting in the morning and dedicating whole periods of time to just work really helped me. Also, having dedicated spaces that I associate with work helped a lot. I used a computer lab and a library to do most of my work. These days it's the office or my study.

I think Pomodoro works because it gives us a structure to work within. Before I started using it I would try to meet abstract measures of effort which only sabotaged my sense of accomplishment. It breaks what might be a five hour work cycle into small doable bits. 

I also can't stress how important it is to have a support network. The Pomodoro method relies on our being able to stick to it rigidly. Having someone who empathizes with your experience and wants to follow the same structure can be amazing for motivating ones self. This is even more valuable to someone with ADD as we have an experience which can be hard to share with those who haven't dealt with it themselves (the study partner doesn't have to have ADD themselves, merely a sympathetic ear). 

TL:DR The Pomodoro method provides a structure for completing tasks that I found effective in increasing my productivity.

"It's one of those things I can see the value in, because frankly our version of ""consensus building"" is still a horribly primitive version and will need to be changed, likely many times, in our future. 

Imagine a not too distant future where technology is dragging us forward at exponential rates and because of uninformed voters we're repeatedly stalled 4+ years at a time while we wait to correct broken systems and goals. That's not a sustainable system because those 4 years could be absolutely critical in the country's development depending on the ever more complex dynamics in the world. Scrapping FPTP would help significantly to at least prevent false positive majorities like our current one, but if you read into cybernetics you need a system that accounts for far more inputs than that lest it eventually catastrophically fail when external forces speed up too quickly for it to respond, and respond appropriately too. 

The reason I'm staunchly against it is because consensus development is a hard challenge, and something we're really just breaking the tip of the iceberg on now in the grand scheme of things, so trusting a government to legislate a working implementation of it for the foreseeable future would be folly. Who would decide the metrics? How would we test their knowledge? How would responses be weighted and accounted for? Would disqualifications be permitted, or would we just apply multipliers to votes? I cringe to think of what the answers from politicians would be for these and any number of additional critical questions. 

I do think eventually we will have a system that has far more inputs, and it will be a system that looks nothing like the ""check off a box once every four years"" version of voting we have now, but until there's a clearer picture of what that looks like that doesn't destroy the spirit of what our voting is meant to represent, I remain staunchly opposed to it.

"Not many of the answers I think you're looking for on this thread, allow a republican (although I do not necessarily want him to win the nomination) that understands his appeal, to explain where I am on this. For a long time republicans have been very frustrated with leadership, this is especially true in more recent years. After this years midterm republicans have won both the house and senate and control congress, however we feel not much has been done to take advantage of this. For example, building the wall at the border with Mexico. Almost all republicans support this, so why hasn't there been effective legislative action to get this done? Most feel that this is due to incompetent republican leadership in congress. Therefore, when trump comes out and starts talking passionately about an issue that frustrates many, people flock towards him. This point has been beaten to a dead horse in the media, but it's true. Trump taps into a facet of his party that's filled with angst towards the politicians in Washington they once supported. Another lesser reason is his disregard for political correctness. In this PC world, a lot of Americans are tired of the pandering, apologizing, and back-tracking people have to do so others don't get offended. When trump says in the debate that he ""Doesn't have time for political correctness,"" It stands out to myself and other conservatives that are really tired of that. With this combination of actions, he has won the minds of many. 

Disclaimer: I'm only pointing out the legitimate upsides to trump in the minds of republicans, like myself. I am not arguing trump for president.

I love questions that settle misunderstandings between party lines, whereas, this is how we grow together as a country, with respect and clear knowledge of other people's opinions. If you or anybody else wants something about republicans cleared up, or is looking for healthy debate, I'm a PM away.

"This is clearly a fantastic and well-reasoned comment, but the crux of its argument is flawed.

&gt; Seriously...how the fuck could Trump be WORSE than the parade of human turds in suits that march into the Capitol and White House every day, every year?

Yes, politics in America is a joke (across the world, really, but who's keeping score)? ^[1] But to answer your question? How much worse could he really be?

He could be a lot fucking worse. Although our political system is in shambles, the United States is in relatively good shape, practically speaking. Although we've been involved in many unnecessary military conflicts over the years, we live in a more peaceful and bountiful society than every before. Violent crime rates are dropping consistently over the years. 80% of young people own a smartphone these days! We're living in the future in many, many ways.

We have many serious problems now and ahead, as a country and as a planet. In the USA, our cops are too violent. Our inner-city schools are a mess. There's obesity. Bullying. Racism. And as a planet, unless we build towards a sustainable future, we'll pollute our planet to a point where it's no longer habitable.

**My point is that Trump isn't providing a plan to change any of this.** The fact that he's ""different"", and ""pisses off all the politicians on both sides"" doesn't mean shit. He's another cog in the capitalist American machine. The fact that he's rich enough to not give a shit doesn't somehow make him magically better than anyone else. There's always the ""outsider"" candidate who will ""change the way things are done in Washington."" You hear that in every election, from local all the way up to national.

I want to end this comment by saying how much I appreciate yours. Some of the best stuff I've read on reddit.

"Racial discrimination is not ""morally tolerable."" Rather, it is roundly criticised and stamped out when it pops up. Thus, it lacks the backing of social power. You can't expect people not to discriminate against one another in all sorts of ways, most of them petty and meaningless. But if society as a whole reacts strongly against that discrimination, you can't really call it all that problematic, because society as a whole is standing against it and that's about as good as things get.

Racism is what happens when society doesn't stand together against racial discrimination. And it unfolds very predictably, with the same kinds of people targeted over and over again and the same excuses invoked. There has to be something wrong with you if you don't think it's more important to stand with the targets of discrimination when no one else is. 

And if you payed much attention to psychology you'd know about the self-serving bias and the creation of victimization complexes which allow the oppressors to justify their actions to themselves. It's lazy and morally repugnant to simply throw your hands up and walk away when confronted with conflicting accounts of racism; to do so is inherently to side with the oppressor as they are the ones inflicting actual damage. Instead, what you need to do is look at the evidence and see who has the social power, who's reacting defensively, and who started the fight.

Racism is socially acceptable racial discrimination. Personally, I think it's more important to make all racial discrimination socially unacceptable than to make all racial discrimination nonexistent. And really, you can't have the latter without the former (if you can have it at all). We definitely don't have the former, so why are we even worrying about the latter now?

Medium mammals tend to adopt mischievous, resourceful personalities when awakened. Used to living in vast ecosystems full of larger predators, these creatures are accustomed to using any advantage they have, banding together with allies or manipulating others to serve their own designs.

In battle, these animals tend to be smart and savvy, shrewd at observing situations and determining whether it would be most advantageous to fight or run. Those animals who prefer combat to diplomacy tend to value speed and stealth, *thus making barbarians and rogues natural choices*, yet the natural curiosity of many smaller animals may also lead them to the study of magic, from wizardry to druidism*, which brings their own environments under their control.

"Man, by the look of your answers I think you're too focused on the problems. Fuck every obstacle lad. Just do what you have to do.

First real fact: without zero cred, and lacking a portfolio or even a degree in something related to cinema, it will be completely impossible for you to win a grant or pull off a successful crowd-sourcing campaign. Do you even have a screenplay ready? Concept art? Storyboards? Budget breakdowns?

Why cinema? Do you have any formal or informal training? What books have you read about film language?  

Want to know where to begin?  Read books about film history, production and theory. And watch at least a film per day. There are also a handful of very cool youtube channels that can help you out. And this forum is a great aid. If you need suggestions send me a PM and I'll give you a list of books and Youtube channels to check out.

After you have the basics covered, write your script and test it with friends or here in reddit. Ask people to give you feedback. Polish your story according to that. Wash, rinse, and repeat.

At that point, you'll be ready to get your hands dirty. Learn a 3D software like Blender and an audio package like Audacity. (both free and extremely powerful). Create a scene of your screenplay the best way you can possibly can. You'll only need your brain. your hands and a computer.

Up to this moment you've moved from square one, from not having anything to show and not knowing anything about cinema, to having a couple of minutes of pristine, kick-ass 3D animation under your belt. You can go two ways from there. Use all the material you've created so far to attract talent and funding, (Your finished screenplay, and the animated clip) or continue solo to finish the thing all by yourself in animation.

This little game plan sounds like climbing Mount Kilimanjaro with high heels, and it really is something similar. It would take you many months or even a couple of years of hard work and sacrifice. But it can be done and has been done before. Your situation is somehow similar to mine a few years ago. I was stuck studying psychology, had student loans and housing bills to pay and was unemployed. And like a shiny cherry on top of the pile of shit, I was really unhappy. What I really wanted to do was to make films. So, one day I decided to put my shit together. I bailed out of uni, found a part time job, taught myself how to write, how to shoot, and ultimately won a $10k grant. I used it to shot [this](http://estamosobservando.com/), a little monster in which I've been working on for a few years now.

Great things are built out of hard work and solid foundations. There is no other way.  You can't expect to kickstart a film career over night. Bro, the only thing that stands between you and your dreams is time and hard work. So just go for it. Start now.

"My teacher told this story.

Him and his buddies were about 16 and were walking down the railroad tracks behind his house one night - just for shits. I'm pretty sure they were drinking, but he was my teacher so he omitted that part.

They come across this guy that he described as wearing a long silver beak mask. He said the mask looked like the guy in Beetlejuice - only silver. They all thought it was one of their friends fucking with them so they start antagonizing him.

All of a sudden the guy in the silver beak mask pulls out a revolver and levels it at one of their heads. At this point they're freaking out, hands up, scared fucking shitless.

The guy pulls the trigger *click* - nothing. Points it at the next friend *click* - nothing. Points it at my teacher *click* - nothing. Then the guy in the silver beak mask just walks past them away into the night.

They're standing there totally frozen in fear for a couple of minutes. Then start freaking out - do we go after him, do we call the cops (this is before cell phones), did that actually happen? What the actual fuck?

All of a sudden BANG! They hear a gunshot off in the distance but WAY too close for comfort and all start to run as fast as they can back home. One of his friends literally puked from being so afraid.

"Yayy, reading responses on these kinds of threads is fun. Let's see...

1) Nope, not yet. A completely F2P player. I have considered it, but I think I'd rather just spend my money on console games since I tend to get tired of apps more quickly. Also, the whole gambling aspect doesn't appeal to me. I understand the thrill of scouting, but I also understand the disappointment that often comes with it. I really don't want to spend a ton of money on the off-chance I get exactly the cards I want.

However, absolutely no judgment from me for people who like to spend money on this game. It's your money, and you're allowed to spend money for your own personal satisfaction and happiness. People spend exorbitant amounts of money on what may seem like inane things to others, but to them personally, it's important. For example, I really don't see the appeal in spending money on collecting Beanie Babies, but for some people, it's what gives them enjoyment, satisfaction, and a way to spend money for hobbies and such. There is no shame in spending money on what you enjoy because really, after spending money on utility bills, food, education, charity, etc., where are you going to spend the rest of your disposable income?

2) If my desperation to get SLG Eli becomes too overwhelming, I may cave and use some of the money I have left in my Google Play account ~~but I'm praying my obsession doesn't get that far~~.

3) Ahaha, $500 would go to my study abroad fund, not for SIF. If I wasn't studying abroad this year, then I would just save it for getting console games or just put it in my bank account.

"While traveling across country (USA), I went to this bar after checking into a shitty motel in a small college town. The bar is closing in 30 minutes and I'm in a good mood and still wired from driving, so I had a few quick drinks and made friends with these two guys at the bar. We left, smoked a bowl in the alley nearby and these three cute girls joined us. The two guys I was with headed home and it's me and these three girls, walking around town, 3am. Some guy rolled up on a bike and started talking to one of the girls. Let's call her Shelly. We were all pretty stoned and drunk and Shelly ends up wandering off with bike guy. The other two girls said something like ""oh she always does that"". I assume Shelly knew the guy and we continue the night, walking around, smoking weed.

A couple hours later I'm walking from the girls' apartment to the motel just as the sun is started to rise. I saw Shelly in a parking lot talking to a cop near his car. She looks like she's been through hell, like she's been crying. The cop did all the talking for her, he said they were waiting for her mom to come pick her up. I've seen people upset before but I never saw a face that looked like hers. I can still see it as clear as day. She looked horrified. The cop said that she had gotten lost walking around and got scared and confused, but he had this odd look on his face too, like a look of concern. I asked her if she wanted me to stay and wait with her for her mom. She says no. I don't even really know this girl at all but I feel like something is off. The cop tells me he'll make sure she gets home okay.

I got back to the motel and my stomach is in a knot. I can't sleep. After putting the whole night together, I realized that the guy on the bike probably snuck off with Shelly, ducked into an alley somewhere and raped her. I felt like I have to find the other two girls and tell them what I saw, what happened. I get about 1 hour of sleep and I grab a bite to eat and drive around town, trying to find the house where the three girls lived. I can't remember what it looks like but thinking I'll see it and remember. I don't. As I'm driving around town I see the town is full of transients, mostly drunks/addicts laying around in parks. Many of them have bikes. I start looking for the guy. Never find him. I don't have any of the girls' numbers but they have mine. I wait around until about 5pm to hear from them but I still haven't to this day. I can barely remember their names now. I do remember the third girls name.

"i'm unfamiliar with how autodesk sketchbook pro works, but if you can make a hard round brush with opacity pressure sensitivity you might be able to get the same overlay effect and have a sharper drawing.

for the hair, try to think of each section of hair like a different clump, and follow the direction of hair as it flows from the hair line and where it parts. exercise line economy and use as little lines as possible to describe a shape. unless you are going for that super detailed/realistic style of drawing as many strand of hair as possible - i won't try to stop you, but i personally don't think it looks very good on anime style characters.  Lilly's hair is tricky for this because in her sprites she has a lot going on, but you can always look up similar hairstyles on real people and use that information to make a more informed decision on how you'd like to approach her hair. 

and, of course, the more you draw a character and hair in general, the more experienced you will get. as i've drawn Lilly many times in the past, the way i approach her hair changes as time goes on.

"Inflammation has a number of components, each with multiple effects; for example, if you sprain your ankle, the swelling of the surrounding tissue will actually impair you healing in the long term (because swelling beyond a certain point impairs blood flow), but the swelling will also serve to stabilize your joint. 

From an evolutionary perspective, the precise amount of inflammation that you develop is tuned to an ancestral environment in which splints, crutches, medical advice, and paid time off were not available. For example, inflammation of musculoskeletal injuries partly serves to heal and partly to immobilize you, so you will not aggravate the injury. If you are willing to stay off the injured limb without help from pain and swelling, then it is beneficial to turn down the amount of inflammation, so that you can avoid the side-effects of inflammation that are actually detrimental to healing (such as excessive swelling). 

In short, inflammatory response is adapted to an environment that most humans no longer live in, and therefore we can adjust it to better suit our present environment and get more efficient healing results.

Of course, you can also screw this up — by popping a bunch of anti-inflammatory drugs and then walking to work on a sprained ankle.",false,false,t1_cu5jylt,airbornemint,,0,1439784309,t5_2qm4e,t3_3h8pee,t3_3h8pee,7,1441296114,0,0,cu5jylt,askscience,7,,

"&gt;If this is how she felt, why the fuck string me along? Why not end things the moment that she began feeling that way to make things as easy a break as possible. Doing the right thing is apparently that hard, I guess.


Well not to defend her other actions, but this is probably because if we always do things based on how we feel in one given moment without having time to sort it out, we could be making very bad decisions. I mean, would you honestly feel better if she went to bed with you one night in love and then woke up the next morning not in love and broke up with you on the spot? No, you would want to give her a chance to process her feelings and make sure what she was feeling wasn't some temporary ""funk"" for lack of better term.


That said, there isn't really anything to sort out. The only advice is to cut her out from your life, go no contact, and focus on yourself.

"&gt;well, i don't think any relationship where one party has more hand/power is equal/reciprocal/healthy.

And there's where we disagree.

&gt;but what kind of relationship is it, where one person improves their health and the other doesn't? sounds like there's a disconnect, values mismatch. that will, justifiably, kill a relationship. 

Well, that oversimplifies some of the situations I've seen of this.

I know you hate anecdotes, but I'll share one anyway.  I knew a couple who were very much in the below average category.  Both were significantly overweight for pretty much the same reasons -- lazy, sedentary lifestyles -- and this is one of the reasons why they hit it off and got along.  Didn't judge each other and so on, it was a part of their dynamic.  Scroll forward a few years after the first baby, and she decides to keep on going when she's losing the residual pregnancy weight and ends up losing weight she had before she was pregnant -- a significant amount of it, such that she was significantly more attractive.  The guy kept living the way he (and they) had always lived, and within a year they were separated.  I'm not going to say she was ""unjustified"" in not staying with a man when she could attract a hotter guy, but it's a case where one person's values *changed* during the course of the relationship -- kind of blindsides the person with whom they were on the same page previously.

That's why one thing I always, always advise guys is that they need to maintain the same ""delta"" of attractiveness that they have with their partner in order to avoid problems.  So if she is changing her lifestyle and getting hotter, you need to do so as well, otherwise you could be easily looking at divorce.  Some people think this is ""unfair"" because the other person ""signed up for you as you were when they married you"", but that isn't how marriage works in 2015 -- if your spouse improves and you don't, there is a massive shift in power, and the relationship will often end.  Always pay attention to that delta -- it's key.",false,false,t1_cu9r99i,grendalor,Red Rain,0,1440095414,t5_2ya42,t3_3hqgl2,t1_cu9qxro,6,1441368896,0,0,cu9r99i,PurplePillDebate,6,,redpill

"I just watched Vanuatu not too long ago since I had never seen the season and I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. I think in the beginning it definitely was kinda boring with the men since it was pretty obvious what was going on. But I think after the tribal swap that's when the game really took off. I also think that everyone that made jury was a pretty great character and I wouldn't mind seeing pretty much anyone from merge return. 

I can see though why some people might not be into it, it's definitely an odd season with some very strong personalities. Personally I think the women make this season as all the men minus Chris are kinda boring or annoying in some way. I liked Sarge (Lea) until I heard his final tribal council speech what was up with that, and then on the reunion I remember him saying something weird again. 

Also just an interesting note about Ami on this season. She really is a very interesting character. I watched Micro first and she is just completely different on Micro than she was on Vanuatu it is so strange. She also has a very satisfying story arc I feel like. She starts off as this leader head bitch, and then kind of ends up all alone with her alliance picked off one by one.

"1. Only real difference between top and bottom is that bottom is near dragon, so having 2 members bottom is handy for dragon control in the early game. At low levels you are probably also seeing 2 members top in some of your games, but this is not standard for higher levels of play. Mid lane is different than both of those because it is a shorter lane and that favours certain champions more than others. If you'd like me to elaborate on this I can

2. Buy them in the store, and then go to your rune pages in your summoner profile and add them. I wouldn't concern yourself with runes really but you can buy some tier 1 runes if you'd like.

3. Yes, and knowing when to do so is a key skill you'll develop over time. Don't blindly run to help but if you know they are getting ganked and you can probably make it there in time and help it can be worth it

4. Yes. Try to run a bit at first and hopefully blow some of their summoner spells, but if death is certain either do as much damage to them as you can or try to kill a couple more creeps before you go down.

5. In a teamfight it's gonna depend on the other champions around (even if you can't hurt the enemy, if you can stun him or something long enough for teammates to hurt him you shouldn't run). If it's a 1v1 or something and you can't hurt him.... ya do your best to run.

The Falcon needs fancy navicomps and strong hyperdrives to be able to get close to the black holes without worrying about being kicked out of hyperspace by the black hole's gravity shadow.

Serenity is dealing with a whole other ball of wax.  She can come in at appreciable realspace speeds and use that to plot a hyperbolic orbit around the hole such that she does get physically closer than the realspace plot of the Falcon's course.

"First thing I noticed is a bit of rounding in your reach back.  Make sure that your reach back is in line with the line that you want your disc to follow.  Rounding costs you both power and accuracy.

Another thing I noticed is your plant foot coming off of the ground.  This is the result of a couple of things:

1. Weight transfer: A lot of your power will come from the transfer of your weight from being on your left foot to being entirely over your plant foot in your drive.  Right now, you're stopping your weight transfer somewhere inbetween, and that's causing you to lose a lot of power, as well as your balance after your throw.

2. Body position: You are currently leaning back when you throw.  This affects both power and release angle.  If you find you are consistently releasing on an anhyzer when you would like to release on a hyzer, try leaning forward over your disc instead of leaning over backward.  This will also allow you to capitalize more on the power that is generated by your hip motion.

Right now your entire body is rotating at the same time.  Think of your throw as a chain reaction: You begin with your weight transfer from your left to right foot.  Drive your weight forward over your right foot (Dan Beto talks about kicking up your left foot to ensure that your weight is over your right foot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nED7gcXobEo).  Next, your hips rotate, which is followed by your chest/shoulders, and finally your arm unfurls fulcrum by fulcrum (shoulder-elbow-wrist).  The momentum of each motion builds until you finally release the disc, always accelerating.

Speaking of accelerating, start slower.  Drive deliberately, not quickly.  Accelerate through your entire run-up.

Also, as others have said, it's okay to look away from the target for a second.  In fact, it's preferable and gives you more power to not restrict yourself with your head.  (https://youtu.be/30cUNsWOYSI?t=306 - The rest of this video is great as well)

You may need to re-evaluate your grip.  The disc seems to be coming out a little bit nose-up.  Make sure that the pads of your fingertips are gripping the inside of the rim, not the tips, and make sure that when the disc lies in your hand it's directly in line with your forearm.  I believe Will talks about grip in that video as well.  If it's not that one, it's his longer tutorial that should be in the suggested videos for that one.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0gzNIRxRbY - Great tips; I REALLY suggest watching this one all the way through.  Goes over all (I think) of what I said in better detail.

If I can think of anything else, I'll make an edit.  Hope this helps.

EDIT:  Noticed that you are rounding in front a bit as well.  Make sure that you are keeping the disc close to your core (the area right above your stomach and below your chest), and keep your elbow up and pointed at the target.  The top pros all drive with their elbows out front, like they are trying to elbow in a door (which is a really good way of conceptualizing a drive).",false,false,t1_ctrsiwe,Brian_B_,,0,1438736340,t5_2qk68,t3_3fsvai,t3_3fsvai,5,1440286278,0,0,ctrsiwe,discgolf,5,,

"How can you like her less in Shippuden? She's far more likeable, hell by the end of the series I downright didn't mind her.

I mean, she's no Hinata, but she's at least useful, she gets things done and she's determined enough to stand alongside the main cast. She winds up being a fairly good legacy of Tsunade.

And then, for all her good parts she's let down by never moving on a single bit from a childhood crush and having almost zero emotional growth. She deserved the ending she got, everyone did really.

(Although, this is coming from only reading the manga though, she was unbearable in the part1 Anime, it might be that she's just as bad in part2 Anime).

EDIT: I will say she was unbearable in RTN though. Non-canon and all that, it was disgusting how she treated Naruto at the end of that movie, blew me away how thoughtless and selfish she could be.

If you're at the stage of having users and passwords then you should start looking at databases. Sqlite is inbuilt to Python and I can highly recommend it. Basic SQL is a must have for any programmer, as databases are ubiquitous in just about everything software and web related.

Try using [simple-crypt](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simple-crypt/1.0.0) with sqlite3. The basic method is to take a password from a user, encrypt the password using the password as the key (simple-crypt automatically uses a salt).

Apply to MAs if you're applying to top 15 programs. You're not gonna get into a history PhD program that's that good. I didn't realize this, got rejected from 10 schools, two of which deferred me to their MA programs, one of which I'm going to. Don't be too discouraged, you can still get into top flight MAs. The higher the tier, the more likely they will be to grant funding. I got into a top five masters program and managed to land a full tuition scholarship. Coupled with other grants and generous teaching or other campus jobs, I may end up having to take out a few thousand dollars in loans over the next two years, but nothing odious. If you can land a good enough gig, employment right after should be a cinch (especially if not academic) in which case a few grand shouldn't be too much of an issue.

Apply to PhD programs of middling to high quality. I guess it depends on how good your undergrad was, but good state schools will still accept you to PhD programs fully funded. The only place I got in as a PhD student, of my 11, was UCLA, which, tbh, has a pretty damn good history department. So don't despair that you **must** have a masters to get into a PhD program.

Also, you have a way better resume than I do. The teaching for a year may very well negate all of what I just said. I found out that I was probably going to be rejected from all my schools from a professor with whom I had a personal connection, who let me know that they typically don't accept students straight out of undergrad. They prefer students with teaching or other types of professional background and I can only imagine that teaching ranks very highly on their list of preferred professions. They're gonna be looking for grad students who can TA effectively, and guess what, you check out.

Reach out right now for letters of recommendation. If you can't do it in person, send very nice emails, remind them of how you know them, what classes you took, and be sure to offer to send them any papers, transcripts, etc that they might want.

One thing that really helps, at least in my experience, is reaching out personally to the profs you want to work with. You'll obviously want to mention them in your statements of purpose, but reach out, let them know who you are, what you're interested in, and what work of theirs you really like. It'd be great if you read their work, but if you can't manage that, go on JSTOR and read reviews of their stuff. Most won't respond, but who cares. Those who do respond have a good chance of going into the ring for you. If they can even remember your name come admissions time-booyah. This is how I got into the Ivy League and how my friend got into Caltech, MIT, and UT-Austin. Yeah, maybe it's just a coincidence, but in my experience reaching out personally is the most crucial thing as long as everything else is golden. This is what separates out the 90 percentile and the 95 percentile, which is where you gotta be for grad school.

Your GREs are fine, close to mine, I'm assuming your writing is at least a 5 (it better be). This is really just to weed out the guy with the 4.0 who stood out at University of Nebraska at Summerbrook but is actually an idiot from the same guy on paper who's very intelligent. That kinda thing. Harvard's median GRE is like 157 or something.

With regards to writing/research, you've got a bunch of time before submissions are due. Start writing a blog or something. Probably the biggest advantage I had was primary source research experience, and quite a bit of it. If you can't rustle up any of that, just have an internet presence where you've posted a couple articles about applicable stuff that you can link them to. Not sure how helpful that is, it might be too late, but it certainly can't hurt for you to mention books you've read and papers you've written in your spare time. Worst case scenario, it'll get you back in practice for grad school. Also, you're applying to European History (me too!). Do you have languages? I fucking hope so. If not, get your ass on duolingo, finish that shit, and tell them you've got B1/B2 certification in at least one language. The MA programs I got into were European Studies (as close to a masters in European history as I could find). They require two European languages at fourth semester level or better to graduate. Can you do that?

Anyway, I've droned on long enough and I've been up for like 20 hours so this is careening towards illegibility. I'll be back tomorrow to fix this up and add stuff I remember.

"Found it hard to read (it's rather badly written and somewhat misguided imo), but there are numerous problems with combining Zen philosophy with a Jewish hashkafah.

First of all - let's start with deities. Buddha is **not regarded as a God** by his followers. Buddha was nothing more than a teacher. He wasn't a prophet, he wasn't any different from any of us. Even the deities of those sects of Buddhism that have them for the sake of populism (vajrayana, pure land) are bound to the same ultimate law as we are. **Worship as it is seen in Abrahamic religions is not incorporated into Buddhism**, so you can't just say that you worship the Jewish God instead of Buddha - it doesn't make sense.

Moreover, **Zen views God as a *fundamentally irrelevant* concept**. It does not take God's existence into account, so even though this philosophical framework allows for his existence, it ultimately doesn't matter, which is a huge problem for someone looking to combine the practices, if you ask me. 

Halakha is fundamentally incompatible with dhamma as following something for the sake of following it would, no doubt, be considered a **source of suffering** by any Buddhist thinker.

As someone who was influenced a lot by Buddhist philosophy and sees undeniable beauty in this approach to life and is getting more and more familiar with chassidut, I can see that, while both these approaches have similar concepts (the most important of which is loving-kindness towards others and being thankful for what you have), they **differ in two very important aspects** that not allow them to be practiced alongside each other:

a) Judaism has a large legal framework with a lot of mitzvoth that apply to some people and not to others. Jews are obligated to follow a lot of things which all the other people aren't. As I previously mentioned, **Buddhism only concerns itself with the universal** and the Jewish approach of 'us vs them' that we so often see has no place in it. Even the mythical creatures, mostly borrowed from the local folklore and later incorporated into the Buddhist philosophy, are subject to suffering, death and rebirth, unless they achieve nirvana. **Buddhism sees all sentient beings as equal** - I am alive and you are alive and therefore nothing else matters. So in order to properly follow the laws of niddah and kohanim, one must first allow himself to treat different groups of humans differently because of formalities.


b) Zen considers seeing reality as it is on the most basic level the highest vritue possible. No matter how you look at it, **halakhah is full of concepts that aren't for us to experience** and it will undermine your Buddhist practice. Emunah, so central to Judaism, does include 'letting go of things', but is so much more than that. I can't see how it is possible to combine Torah, with all the pre-conceptions it has that we are required to believe in, with something that requires us to let go of our concepts.

All in all, it's an extremely interesting topic, especially if you compare what's similar between the two religions, and I didn't even cover meditation and hitbodeut. Something in Buddhism just seems to attract Jews for some reason :)",false,false,t1_ctxp1pr,chutzpantsu,עטור מצחך זהב שחור,0,1439186076,t5_2qi67,t3_3gf1lu,t3_3gf1lu,5,1440388354,0,0,ctxp1pr,Judaism,5,,

"Any of the [Spiderweb software iPad games](http://www.spiderwebsoftware.com/products.html) would fit the bill.  The guy who makes those has been making very deep and rich RPG's with many branching plot lines and environments to explore for decades, and each of his games has many hours of custom-crafted encounters and stories to explore.

I'll second planistbygrace's recommendation for *Final Fantasy Tactics*.  It's mostly tactical combat, but it's got a good storyline around it.  (Can't vouch for the others he mentioned.)

*Out There* has some good emergent story.

There are several ""gamebooks"" on iPad, which are basically digital versions of those choose-your-own-adventure books, only with combat mechanics thrown in.  *Sorcery*, *Fighting Fantasy*, and *Joe Dever's Lone Wolf*, for example, are some good ""sword and sorcery"" ones, and *Appointment with F.E.A.R.* is a humorous superhero one.  There are scores of other ones, too.

If you like more ""atmospheric"" stories, *Year Walk* is really engrossing, as are *The Room* series.  Beautifully done, with nice experiences.

There are some excellent games in the ""point and click adventure"" genre, such as *The Journey Down* and *Broken Age*.  Also, there are several TellTale games available, such as *Walking Dead*, *A Wolf Among Us*, *Back to the Future*, etc. - those are all excellent.

*Galaxy on Fire* is a sandbox space game with a storyline laid over it that's pretty good.

*King of Dragon Pass* is a really deep, engaging story-driven empire simulator.  It looks pricey, but it's very deep.  You play as the leader of a clan, and you have to shepherd the clan through various story-driven challenges.  Very often, the decisions you make - and there is very seldom a clear ""best"" choice - have ramifications on your progress down the line.  A lot of custom-crafted content there.

*Waking Mars* is a puzzle-platformer with some good story to it.

That ought to get you started!

"You can call Prescott Bush a ""Nazi"" if you want... but what does that word mean in that context, exactly? 

Grandpa Bush was an international banker, and they don't see things the way most people do. Do you think Brown Brothers Harriman supported Hitlers rise because they believed in his ideology? No, they're in business to make money, and more importantly, to gain power and manipulate world affairs to serve their interests. 

The big boys like J.P. Morgan, Rockefeller, the Rothschilds and Brown Brothers Harriman use national politics and politicians like pawns on a chessboard. They create wars and fund **both sides**, driving all nations involved into their debt.

The rise of Hitler and the rearmament of Germany was done to serve larger political goals that could only be achieved through the destruction and chaos that war brings. They amassed huge fortunes, further consolidated their power, and rearranged the world political landscape to their advantage. 

Nazism, Communism, Capitalism, Democracy... they don't give a shit. These are all just labels to keep the masses confused and hating and fearing one another. 

The Big Boys - the crowd that Prescott Bush was running with, and that his descendants continue to run with - aren't  are interested such bullshit. Their only concern is how these ""ideologies"" can be manipulated against one another to serve their own agenda.

"[Gravy - Red Beans, Red Wine &amp; Rebuilds: a Katrina Anniversary Special (Gravy Ep. 20)](https://www.southernfoodways.org/gravy/red-beans-red-wine-rebuilds-a-katrina-anniversary-special-gravy-ep-20/)

&gt;Ten years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, how does the city’s food reveal how the place has changed? This hour-long special episode of Gravy takes on that question, from what was eaten just after the storm to the stories of two restaurants that tap into the post-Katrina gentrification and marketing of New Orleans to the outside world.

&gt;In part one, we hear the personal stories of three New Orleanians, taken from blogs they kept in the immediate aftermath of Katrina. Food figures largely in their writing, and that food reveals residents who were already wrestling with what had irrevocably changed and what was holding true about their city. These blog posts are included in the new collection Please Forward, edited by Cynthia Joyce.

&gt;In part two: what does a once-bohemian wine store and restaurant in one of the city’s fastest gentrifying neighborhoods show us about the cultural transformation that part of town is undergoing? Writer Sara Roahen brings us the story of Bacchanal and the Bywater.

&gt;And in part three: was the post-storm resurrection of a beloved soul food restaurant in New Orleans uniformly a good thing?

"Let's put the whole ""marriage"" thing aside, okay? I see the problem in something different: if two people can't communicate with each other and get things done one way or another — it's a bad sign for a relationship. But an ultimatum is *never* a good way to solve it. And if you're put in front of a choice like this by your SO or anyone else — that's an ever worse sign. What I mean is if you give in it creates a precedent, so the other one now has a leverage over you and will use it when he/she wants it. Today it's a marriage, but what will it be tomorrow? if a person thinks from the start that it's a nice strategy to force you to choose what he/she wants than you shouldn't probably get involved in a serious relationship with that person.

"In a nuke event refineries would certainly be included in the secondary target list.  Same for power plants and dams.  

The whole supply chain is contingent on continuing, constant fuel.  Which has to come from somewhere.  Once you stop pumping oil though or even significantly impact the supply chain between end point delivery trucks a clock starts.  When that clock runs out you've run out of fuel to the point where you can no longer easily restart the supply chain.  So if major refineries are hit, even if you could still get the oil out of the ground you couldn't do anything with it.   It takes time and fuel to build and repair refineries and that clock is ticking while your trying to rebuild.  

There's all sorts of fragile things that would break after a nuclear exchange.  The global economy would collapse basically overnight.  If not from National animosity but from trade disruption.   Much of the business world functions on the assumption that growth will continue unabated.  If you even slow down growth, it's a catastrophe.  Look at 2008.

"So the fact that in a lot of cases ""just move"" isn't feasible that means it is NEVER an option an any mention of it in a list of possible solutions means I don't understand the situation? Seems like you need to work on your reasoning here.

I have done church work for years. We offer a free dinner once a week that is also a ""social"" gathering where out of work people can network with some of the more well off church members that can give them a job. We will provide full on living and sustenance to people if they ask. We collect used suits and our members provide free custom tailoring.

The biggest hurdles we face are people that seem to hate Christianity so much that to even take free stuff from a church is intolerable. We do not require people to pray at our meals, give anything to the church, attend services, or pretend that they believe in God. Oh and there is a secular outfit in town that we partner with and try to direct people to if they can't tolerate us. For people that can tolerate being in the same building as us we struggle getting people to take the work our members offer. Typically $15-$20/hr for farm labor. It seems that physical labor isn't worth it to a lot people even if it means a better life. Used suits, despite being custom tailored, are often ""not good enough"" for people. We don't provide little Debbie's in our meal options, and cheerios/oatmeal aren't as good as cocoa puffs. 

Spend some time doing outreach and you will quickly become a little jaded with people. For every person/family we help we see about 5 that are ""too good"" for us because only stupid people are religious, another 2-3 that think our version of help isn't good enough, 2-3 that just want free stuff and are unwilling to put any effort in on their part, and another one that only showed up to try and ""troll"" us or convince us that God isn't real or something. The sad part is that our congregation is about as tame as it gets when it comes to what people perceive as ""religious people"", and despite all our efforts to make our religious motivation a backseat to the actual mission so many people have allowed politics and entitlement deprive them of an excellent source of help in their life.

So yes, I do beleive a lot of people refuse to take any initiative to help themselves because I see it on a daily basis even when the "" help"" is actively seeking to assist them.",false,false,t1_cuj8fe0,mrp3anut,,0,1440806138,t5_2vizz,t3_3ipj6t,t1_cuj724u,1,1441559138,0,0,cuj8fe0,TumblrInAction,1,,

"My aunt lives up here so I stayed with her until I got back on my feet. I started working for her (she owns a cleaning company) it only consists of her, her friend and her daughter. So I organize all the appointments and shop for supplies and do some cleaning myself. It's A LOT better than jobs I've had in the past. As for why... there's a lot of reasons I suppose. The highest on the list I guess  would be because I needed change. My girl friend of 4 years had just broken up with me after cheating on me repetitively with my best friend and I was crushed. From there it was slowly down hill. I started drinking and smoking cigarettes (or darts as I've heard them referred to up here ) and one day I said fuck it. It was a very sudden design and within 4 months I was out of my small as apartment and up to my aunts slightly bigger house. There are many noticeable changes. Things are more expensive here and getting my license has been an ordeal and the while health card thing confuses me but I haven't been hurt yet so I haven't had to deal with it. Slowly the cool things of my new home began to distract me and gradually the weight was lifted off my chest. The anxiety is gone and I'm happy. The only person I've made contact with from back home is my mother. Though I've seen on Facebook my once best friend is dating the woman I thought I'd die with. But in a way I think it was destiny because on a day trip to Victoria I mentioned Sara. We've been dating for I months and I've fallen in love once more.

"Most veteran traders that I've spoken to will tell you that AH should not be seen as an accurate barometer of the price of an equity.  Bear in mind that AH volume for most equities is something like 1/10th of the volume of an ""average"" trading day for that equity.

Also remember that there are a lot of prices to juggle.  Was that 2.64 an actual transaction, or was that just what the Bid price jumped up to?  A bid price of 2.64 is irrelevant if nobody is buying, or because someone managed to sell ONE share at that price.  As soon as the daytime market reopens the next day the price will normalize right back, unless it has an actual reason to gap.

In other words: look for news or SEC filings to see if there's a reason for the price movement AH.  Also look at the volume of that jump and whether or not it's sustained or traded.  If there's no volume and no news, then don't trust that price of be remotely accurate.

"Comparing the female orgasm with housework, is insane. I am SURE, that almost all men likes female orgasm. Men are interested in female orgasm just because their ego or just because they like to give.

&gt; The Case of the Female Orgasm: Bias in the Science of Evolution 
This book was published in 2006. Hope things changed much in 9 years.

The 4-1 oral ratio is staggering to me. I hope they call it **anecdotal** in the article for a reason. I think it can be traced back to porn. Either women get it from there, or they're asked. I think it's only good idea to start sex (even in relationship) with him receiving oral, if he wasn't in the mood that much. Doing so in other situations can result in lower concentration on his side.

&gt; In the one-on-one interviews included in the study, one man explained that with his girlfriend, “definitely oral is really important [for her to orgasm],” but that with a casual hookup, “I don’t give a shit.”

I think this man definitely don't gives sh\*t about one his ONS. Hope to compensate this, he doesn't expect this either. I have to mention, that I can understand, that some men don't want to give oral in such situation: it's not a thing to do with protection and has a higher risk of STDs.

&gt; Even though folklore has it that women don’t achieve orgasms with strangers because they need emotional attachment to feel that sort of pleasure, the truth is that women’s orgasms are not usually the result of emotional attachments, but simple physicality.

Here I lack the explanation. I believe, that most of these cases occur in a bar or party. And it fails to recon with the social inhibition lowering effect of alcohol.

&gt; “The woman really has to be the boss of the sexual experience, because it’s harder for women to have an orgasm through a straightforward sexual position. Women need to start understanding how their clitoral nerves are positioned,” says Angier.

This is an unfortunate pronouncement. Because it can scare off women, who don't want to dominate in sex (due to her personality or social belief).

I hope that this situation does not prevail in the most of the world. Also hope, that in the past 6 years things changed in favor of women.

It occurs to me, that this whole article is a simple advertisement. I am not disagreeing with it, but it's purposes are:

* Sell a product

* Help women

The background of the whole *Orgasm gap* is the lack of appropriate education. It spoils the situation even further, that many people (even women too) consider porn education and not entertainment. In today's worlds free and easily accessible knowledge. It's a shame, that *The Daily Beast* was only observer and not influential factor in the question.

"So, my great grandpa's sister killed 4 people in Georgia. Her name was Anjette Lyles. Basically she owned a super popular restaurant called ""Anjette's"" and would poison people in her food. She poisoned her husband, her second husband, her mother-in-law, her daughter, and tried to poison her other daughter. I recently talked to my grandmother about her, and a lot of interesting things came up. 

My grandmother knew Anjette and hung out with her quite a lot. She commonly brought dates to her restaurant and got free lobster tails, and sometimes Anjette would give her money for stupid things like jackets and all. Overall, Anjette was really good to her. 

A lot of the articles online say she did it for insurance money, and she did get some money, but that wasn't why she did it. She would kill people close to her and then everyone would give her a bunch of attention, because that's really what she wanted. 

I actually know more about this girl and why she killed than pretty much anything you could find online just from one conversation. I won't post any stories or anything unless you all are interested.

"ha my initial response came off as a bit too butt hurtish cuz Guts is losing this fight.
that being said, there are few reasons why i personally think that Guts is a much better character than saber.
First, and this isnt that big of a deal, but the fact that saber is based on already existing historical figure/character in king arthur takes some points away from her.
Then, due to its mainstream LN and shonen nature, I think that there are less dramatic changes that ends up having a long impact on Saber's character.  Where in as in Berzerk, due to its mature nature, a lot more fucked up shit happens to Guts and its impact is felt throughout the series. 
Then there is a fact that saber had innate and powerful powers which helps her in her battle where in as Guts literally started from the bottom as he was born out of a corpse of his mother who was hung.

""besides, the whole throwing more people at the problem being ineffective is about throwing more people at a problem *beyond a certain point. *"" - I won't disagree with this, however it doesn't negate my point. New staff (which is what the previous commentor was suggesting) would have to learn how the studio operates, and then learn their tools/frameworks and then also learn the codebase. All before contributing to the solution. 

If the team is lacking in man power or in a specific area (for example, working on AI but lacking a dedicated AI programmer) then of course a new team member would be beneficial. But if all posts are covered, then new starts can actually cause delays (as someone needs to be removed from full development time to train the new start).

"I so agree here.  With a kitten, you literally do not know what you're getting.  Even the sweetest kitten can hit the hormone wall and go nuts.  With an 'adult' cat, you can usually get a feel for their personality/temperament with just a little bit of time spent with them.

I'd also say shy does not mean not cuddly.  I adopted a 'shy' cat last year, who I was expecting to have to give her some time to get used to the household/my other cat/etc before she warmed up, but after four days at home, she went from shy to 'has essentially not left my lap in over a year'.   So shy could just mean 'I'm sick of this cage everything is awful' not 'I am a shy cat'.

"I went to university in the early 90s. There was no such thing as trigger warnings (or social media).

I sought out classes like that. I enjoyed how they made me think and question my assumptions.

Nowadays you read a lot of reddit posts that say stuff like ""I suffer from anxiety so I can't ___"". I think a lot of people are very damaged from having lived sheltered lives.

"You can say the same both ways. Women choosing not to read books written by men is just as discriminatory as men not reading books written by women. The main difference is that DocWhoc is intentionally discriminating, while other people subtly feel like an author or protagonist of the opposite gender wouldn't relate to them as much. 

I like to read scifi &amp; fantasy, a lot of the most popular series are written by women (Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Divergent). You can notice differences based on gender, romance is an obvious example. The Hunger Games has a love triangle with 2 guys where one is exciting but aggressive while the other is protective &amp; nurturing, this isn't something most guys can relate to, while Divergent has lots of romantic kissing, touching, &amp; feelings without any sexual themes. Gender can change the way things are written, it doesn't make it worse but it can make it less popular with the other gender, &amp; there's nothing inherently wrong with that.

"Yeah in an age where reason is not taught in schools to EVERYONE it is emotion that rules.   Say the right words to fire up the emotional outrage and you've hooked that fish.   Using the right bait is key.


In such an environment hijacking words for redefinition, or emotional impact is the modus operandi.



You are 100% accurate on the phrase ""Conspiracy Theory"" though.   Most people think tin-foil hat as they've been conditioned to do.   They don't think what those two words actually mean and by the definition of those two words **even** the official story for 9-11 is a Conspiracy Theory. 


I also see the term **piracy** when applied to digital copying/theft a being hijacked for emotional impact.   A Pirate would board a ship, steal whatever physical things they wanted, kill if they needed or wanted to, rape if they needed or wanted to, perhaps keep the ship, sink it, or just leave it floating there.   How does that compare to copying a digital item?


The word Terrorism, and Terrorists was also hijacked.  It had a very precise meaning.   These days it is becoming anyone that does not agree with the government, or questions the government.   Go back a few decades and tell that to victims of Terrorism and they'll be pretty outraged.   However, if you go back to the old definition for that word and pay attention you quickly realize that technique is alive and well it is just state sanctioned now, and often techniques applied to its own populace to keep them afraid and under control....  emotions....


Challenging a theory is an important part of the scientific method.   In addition, to be a scientist all one need do is practice the scientific method.   This day and age it is generally meant they went to college for a specific period of time.

We can have more unlimited lifespans, perhaps, which will take generations to centuries to achieve, because our genetics and physiologies are so VERY complicated.

"I just want to get stronger but I feel like I've gotten lost after reading so much.
I've been doing 3x5 greyskull with: bench/ohp(alternating), then bent over row every lifting session, and squat (Mon and Friday)/deadlift (Wednesday) while cutting for the past four months or so and I've lost a lot of weight but haven't gotten much stronger. Here are my current 5 rep max lifts: squat 180, DL 230, bench 120, row 115, ohp 85. 

So should I stick to this 2x5,1x5+ routine as I begin to eat more for a bulk? I saw a routine that was five days a week with one lift per session at 3x5 and then the same lift at 5x10 (50% of 1RM) and another accessory at 5x10 sort've like BBB but the first three sets are all the same weight for 5 reps instead of 5/3/1. So an example squat day could be 3x5 at 180lbs and then 5x10 deep squat at 135 and leg press 5x10 at 170. Would I make better strength gains with that?

"To be blunt, spam-clicking isn't removed for PvP but rather adjusted. In this post there will both be a simple list, and an indepth description for each item on the simple list, describing how it isn't the end of PvP for Minecraft.

DISCLAIMER: Nothing I mention is set in stone, it's merely a set of observations of the current features. The final version could be very different than what we currently see in snapshots.

So without further delay, here goes:

Basic list of Purposes of click-spamming in 1.9:


1. Using the hoe to deal damage as usual.

2. Using the click-spam on any weapon to utilize knockback.

3. Using click-spam to shred through shields.


Indepth

First, the Hoe deals large amounts of damage in a short amount of time. Anytime a player takes lots of damage quickly, they tend to panic and either run, or do something stupid. And anyone who plays PvP knows that he who runs, usually dies. Combine this with the fact that the knockback from the Hoe may disrupt the timed attacks of other weapons, leaving the Hoe user likely to be unharmed.

Second, Using spam-clicking on a weapon throws out more disruptive knockback than timed attacks. Simple fact.

Third, Using spam-clicking to shred through shields. As we've seen in the snapshots, Zombies shred through shields on their own. Now imagine being spam-clicked by a multitude of players. Even if someone is blocking and you don't have an Axe user on your side, a shield-bearer will soon lose the item he took the time to master since shields take full damage in place of the player.

In conclusion, spam-clicking still has it's place. It's just been redefined. All you have to do is look for it.

"I think the issue really is that there is a very very small chance of a ""bubble pop"" in ""tech."" At this point, Tech just isn't some cool thing some companies do, it's almost everything. It's a way of life. It's not going anywhere. Now, there are niches within tech, such as social sharing or chat apps or 3D printers, that will have their ups and downs. They will be more rapid as it's much easier to get in and out of compared to more traditional industries, but the amount of capital pouring in still pales in comparison to the overall revenue growth in many of those niches. But alas, although VC's may act slower in some cases, there will always be tech companies that come from nowhere and end up owning a market with little revenue, but the share itself has tremendous value. FB was worth 16B before it had any real revenue. Obviously it was really worth more and posts huge margins now. WhatsApp is similar.

Regardless, VC's don't determine the future like they had before (when revenue didn't match the amount of VC funding coming in). Now there is so much revenue to be had that it doesn't matter for most startups what a VC values them at. Most successful tech startups don't get and don't need VC money to succeed and make money.

"When I was early in my schooling for accounting, I worked for H&amp;R. And yeah, that article is correct. Most of the people there doing taxes don't know shit about taxes. They were terrible.

One thing you NEED to realize though, some people just don't understand the concept of taxation, or even the concept of financial numbers. Sure, most people can grasp the idea of compound interest, but how many can truly understand something as basic as time-value of money in it's entirety? Some people don't understand the difference between passive income and active income, or earned income and business income. Some people don't get the difference between refundable credits and non-refundable credits. Some people don't know the difference between a deduction and an exemption. Some people don't even know that they pay their taxes from every paycheque, and that a refund is simply an overpayment made by them which the government is reimbursing to them interest free. 90% of the people I did taxes for thought that a refund was just the government giving them money. People don't get it, and I can understand why. That is why I believe basic taxation should be a mandatory high school course. In my opinion, you need to understand the basic concepts of taxation a lot more than you need to understand how to read music. And I say that as a person who can read music.

"You seem mostly asking about support Lina, which is only marginally different than Core Lina. In a teamfight, support Lina plays similar to CM or Lion. Sneak in for a spell combo, then back off while abilities are on cooldown, repeat. With her long range, support Lina can right click pretty well, but only when opponents have shown themselves and are focused on her team mates. It's really not that different than a core Lina, except as a core, you might be a little closer to the front so you can initiate with a Eul's or Hex on an out of position hero. A core Lina can take a little bit more damage, but not much.

1. I think you're right on here. Aghs Laguna against a BKB target is your most important action in a team fight. If you don't have aghs, and they have BKBs then stay hidden until they expire or they occupy themselves on your teammates. You're quite weak if a core jumps on you and you have no defensive item. If they sneak around the back, Force Staff, Glimmer Cape, Ghost Scepter, and **Eul's** are your go to defensive items. Eul's isn't the cheapest option, but it's so good on Lina even as a support, you should shoot for it unless you're having an absolutely terrible game.

2. Stick with your team against invis heroes. If they initiate on you, delay for as long as possible so your team can react. Use whatever defensive item(s) you can. Force staff yourself out of cloud/latch, eul's them, eul's yourself, LSA on top of yourself, glimmer, ghost self. If you're alone, and he is alone you can TP out while you eul's him or glimmer/ghost self. Against Slark, maybe LSA first to force dark pact. Also, Slark actually isn't that Tanky until he has SnY/BKB/Skadi. Without items at level 16 he only has 150 more HP than Lina and about 1 armor more. Riki is about the same HP as slark, but quite a bit more armor. But, Riki players are less likely than Slark to buy HP items, especially if they rush diffusal.

3. 450 right click DPS is insane for a support, especially at 670 range. Lina has one of the best main attribute starting value and growth (27+3.2), so her right clicks are pretty strong even without damage items. The only issue is her abysmal agility growth. But wow, her 3rd skill fixes that, so not right clicking is a bit of a waste. Especially since she can do it from the safety of 670 range. Sure, there are a fair of heroes that can close that gap, even without blink daggers. But it's longer than the range of LSA and Laguna, so you ought to be able to throw at least a few right clicks in after each spell before you slip into the fog of war. It's the longest range in the game until Sniper get's level 2 take aim, Enchantress gets Aghs, or someone picks techies and ruins your game. With brown boots+Eul's and 3 fiery soul stacks, she moves at 415ms, which is enough to kite most hero if they start to go on you.


I'm actually not sure what you considered to calculate 450 DPS but here's some calculations with inputs listed. Numbers pulled from the wiki.

At level 10 with no items and just 1 point in fiery soul, 3 stacks will almost double Lina's DPS from 57 to 111 DPS. Lvl 16 no items: damage= ~100.  Attacks/s = 0.82, so 82 DPS. That's in line with other INT heroes that suck at right clicking like Lion or Lich. However, with 3 fiery soul stacks, her DPS almost triples: Attacks/s goes up to 2.3/s giving 230 DPS with no items. With a typical Core build: Bottle, Treads, Eul's, Aghs, Shadow Blade she'll have +28 int, +22 damage, and +70AS for ~410DPS for 11950g. But even as a support with just Wand, Arcanes and Eul's, it's ~265 DPS, which is respectable.

Let's compare a heavy right clicker, a DPS machine from 6.83, the Juggernaut. A Lvl 16 Jugg with no items: 90 damage * 1.17 Attacks/s *1.35 (crit multiplier) = 142 DPS. That's actually kind of terrible compared to a no item Lina. So let's give him some reasonable items for around the same farm as the Core Lina: Phase, MoM, SnY, Mjollnir for 12890g. That's 170 damage * 1.95 attacks/s(no MoM active) or 2.67 a/s(MoM active) * 1.35. That gives 447 DPS or 612 DPS depending on MoM. So a core Lina does about the same DPS as Juggernaut without MoM and  2/3 DPS with MoM active. A support Lina does 40-60% of Jugg's DPS. So, yeah an agility carry will out right-click a support Lina since he's 9k gold more farmed than her. He will out damage a core Lina eventually, but with numbers like those, how can you doubt that Lina is supposed to right click? 

Which brings me to my next point. Why are you worrying about breaking tranquils? In fact, why are you buying them in the first place. Early game, they're alright I guess. The armor is decent, move speed is nice before you get fiery soul and enough mana/regen to keep it up, and the hp regen is useful between skirmishes/ganks. But mid/late game, you should already be fast with Fiery Soul stacks + Eul's. The unbroken regen doesn't matter at all until after the fight anyway because you should A) be out of the way of most of the action and not taking much damage and B) will be dead anyway if some one starts right clicking you and you can't escape. I don't think tranquils are the boot for Lina at all, even as a support. Arcanes would better serve you and the team usually. Treads are a possibility if your team doesn't have much mana requirements and you think you can get an early Eul's because you're dominating the early game.

So Lina doesn't really need to buy damage items as much as she needs a bit of control and survivability so she can keep casting, kiting, and machine gun fireballing her opponents. Luckily, those utility items tend to give int so her damage continues to scale fairly well into late game. Even as a support, her right clicks are decently strong in a team fight as long as you don't stand still and let them easily close the gap or can respond appropriately if they do.",false,false,t1_cuerwxc,cilantro_avocado,,0,1440478762,t5_2tta4,t3_3i8r8n,t3_3i8r8n,1,1441455371,0,0,cuerwxc,learndota2,1,,

"When McVey bombed OKC building, the earth shook at least 163 miles away, as though an explosion took place right outside your building.     
We were all horrified that it happened, then that it was american, but we weren't scared and totally freaked out. It wasn't ""well, there's got to be another bomber out there-there's going to be more"".     
When WTC was hit, it shook us all to our core. It wasn't ""just"" New Yorkers that died that day, it was loved ones of loved ones. It seemed like everybody lost someone, or someone was supposed to be in a building that was targeted.     
I will never forget the silence of the skies. No airplanes were in the sky. We didn't know if more bombings were coming. We didn't know when air travel would be allowed again. We didn't know how many other cities might be targeted in how many different ways to kill Americans.     
It was a whole new concept.     
How is America worse? all the spying that is done to our own people, against our allies even. That's not good.     
In the name of safety, we have fear. We no longer innocently park in front of a small, local airport awaiting our loved ones to arrive home. We no longer leisurely wait with them at the terminals to await their planes arrival. Goodbyes now take place in front of the car, before it was in front of their plane.     
Trauma isn't tangible.      
We look at each other differently. We don't trust each other and we know that people don't trust us. No matter how much the American people have believed our country to be helpful to other not-so-priveledge nations, we discovered that we were hated so much that guys were willing to give up their own lives in the attempt at taking out as many people on American soil as they could.     
Paperwork has changed. No one is to be trusted. Everything has to be verified down to the last fraction of a hair.     
We used to be a nation of immigrants, now immigrant is a dirty word.    We were attacked without provocation. Americans ceased to care about unknown cultures/people like we once did. Curiosity kills the cat kind of mentality.     
We didn't have the fear of the unknown cultures &amp; peoples of the world. We do now. And its made us mean and uncaring.      ",false,false,t1_cuerztm,Fruit_stripe_Zebra,,0,1440478969,t5_2qh1i,t3_3i97vv,t1_cuerf0b,0,1441455409,1,0,cuerztm,AskReddit,0,,

Also I think everyone on this subreddit should get into wearing good clothes so head on over to r/malefashionadvice and r/teenmfa. I would also strongly suggest hitting the weight room.

"Look at the past performances where Apple has consistently outperformed analysts' expectations and the sheer amount of cash they have.  

They're a growth and tech stock with great PE and a huge pile of cash (to take on anyone in their own industry).  They have shown that they have great engineering and have a premium brand to boot.  Since they do have so much cash, Apple is able to expand into other industries and can give any existing industry leader a run for their money.  If Apple wanted to take on Netflix, Apple would be able to give them a run for the money just due to Apple's brand, influence and money.  Hell, Apple can buy out Netflix entirely without even breaking the bank.  No other company outside of Berkshire and Apple can do this.

You can just see how Apple music is able to compete with Spotify already (they're able to influence artists and put out something that is comparable, especially for an initial release).  

Smart watches are  not even a blip on the radar in terms of revenue for Apple.  Even if the Apple watch failed entirely, Apple's revenue stream wouldn't even skip a beat.  Even then, Apple's smart watch is the by far the best smart watch in the industry. 

In the near future, Apple will have more revenue from 

* Apple Pay
* Apple Streaming (Music, TV)

You could be right that Apple's best days are behind but looking at their future product line, potential, cash and leadership, I'm betting otherwise.

This year (and last year) was that we didn't have any receivers and that we would address it, but Farmer isn't dumb and wasting a high pick on receiver, so he took a lineman. Anyone who paid attention to the team last year knows that the offensive line depth is non-existent.

Mingo has been hurt, but played well despite the narrative that he's a ""bust"", and that draft being one of weakest in a decade.

Is cold the only trigger for the digestive symptoms that you are aware of?

Do any symptoms of panic occur along with the digestive symptoms?

As others have said in your other thread, this appears to be a hormonal issue (probably thyroid related), the digestive issues are unusual but could still be secondary to a thyroid problem.

- Any Moldovan whose ancestors were natives before the second world war (i.e. not brought by Stalin) are eligible to apply for Romanian citizenship without even having to go to Romania, they can apply at the Embassy or any Consulate.

"Personally I think this argument of skylines vs SC2013 is partly attributed to company ideals. SC2013 was crippled by its own launch and simulation but as OP pointed at provides a well thought out route of progression that connects with all the branches of the simulation (ie factories need workers which requires residences which requires basic facilities like fire departments to protect factories and houses). It all meshes and looks beautiful. 

Skylines allows for huge metropolises (?) and customization through mods. The traffic works smoothly and the citizens aren't deadbeats and hold steady jobs with families.  Districts allow for a less overwhelming management. There isn't stuff like crime deterrence or fire deterrence through the field marshals like in SC2013. It's not as deep in some respects.

Both are good games in their on respect. Objectively.

In my opinion (which means jack) EA is not a very nice company. With servers, simulation problems and the complete dissolution of maxis really shows how much the powers that be care about the game.

When we lose a family member we don't talk about it much until well after the fact.

"At the time Fr. Michael McGivney founded the Knights at St. Mary's in New Haven, there was a huge problem facing Catholic Immigrants. They were working in careers with a very high rate of maiming or death on the job: factory workers, longshoremen, etc. Life insurance societies were a rather new invention, but like most fraternal and civic organizations of the time poor Catholic immigrants were excluded from participating - by charter, by law, or by social discrimination.

So these workers formed a fraternal benefits society within the parish, to provide for widows and orphans left behind if a member were to die. It also created a patriotic fraternal society to participate in that was devoted in service to the Holy Church rather than formed in questionable allegiances to Protestant or Secular-Progressive ideologies.

It's a different age now, with lots of life insurance products on the market, but you'll be hard pressed to find one that invests according to Catholic ethical guidelines and devotes its excess revenues to the Church's charitable missions rather than profiting some shareholders.

Yes, you'll often find the public KofC demographic trending towards 40+. That's not necessarily because all the members are that way either, but a lot of the activities the knights do in the parish community are sometimes difficult to balance for fathers with young families. Young practical Catholic gentlemen are always welcome, and almost everyone's been in the same position of being long an enthusiasm and short on time with little kids at home.

"Yeah, loans are products that banks sell, and they compete with one another. That's why re-financing within the same banks exist - if housing rates dropped, I could ask my bank for a re-fi - costing them tens of thousands of dollars in profit - and they'd do it, because they know I can just go to another lender.

Having said that, most loan minimums are around $5,000 for a used car, and I'd imagine you're below that now unless you got low miles and the loan is very recent. So I'm not saying a re-fi is always possible for you, but certainly make a call or two.

Some quick numbers: getting a 15% APR loan saves you $450 over the loan (assuming no extra payments.  Paying $100 one time saves you $72 (assuming you make that payment in the 3rd month, pay every other payment as scheduled). Paying $100 extra every month saves you $650 (assuming you already paid 2 months again). It also means your loan is only 1 year, 9 months.

"Ok so I've been looking into this and I've come up with a tactic which will require me to buy: 2 more hanzo's (just to increase chance of drawing him) they are fairly cheap and I could get 2 for $5 (that includes shipping), I'd also need to buy ""ninjitsu art of super-transformation"" I figure I only need 1 (also not extreemly bad pricing around $3 including shipping), Then finally a white dragon ninja (costs about $15, seems a bit expensive to me for 1 card although really any dragon would do, a blue eyes would probably be better because it has 300 more attack but this costs 1 less and keeps up with the ""ninja"" style of my deck.)

Now I'm still new to Yu-Gi-Oh so I'm not sure if this stratagey would work or if what I want to do is allowed.

So:

1. Get hanzo, this will be more sort of luck which is why I want 2 more to get to the cap of 3.

2. Normal summon hanzo to allow me to draw a ninjitsu art card from my deck, I draw ninjitsu art of super-transformation.

3. Assuming I go 2nd and he has a face up monster with a value of 3 or higher (I'll wait if he doesn't) I then play my ninjitsu art of super-transformation (***NOTE*** This is 1 thing I'm not sure of, am I allowed to just set and instantly play the trap card? do I have to wait a turn after setting it?).

4. Then tribute his monster (with a level of 3 or higher) and then tribute hanzo and that card to have a 2700 attack white dragon ninja on the field early on in the game.

I also got ""Mirror Force"" and ""Mystical Space Typhoon"" as per your recommendation now, so hopefully I can defend if he tries to take out this card.

Is this tactic playable? Should I bother getting a white dragon ninja considering I can't find one for under $15.

"i think for a *that* fast team Orochi even might be not that of a good choice, because what he does, is basically a relatively weak single target nuke on 2nd and a 3rd, which lands dots, which you have to wait for until they ""do damage"".

And faster runs basically just means, you 1-shot waves (and bosses).

Therefore, if i had the mons and runes, i think i would try:

* Lushen lead (to make them possibly clear a wave with amp magic)
* Lushen #2
* Teshar (violent)
* buffer: Shannon, Chasun, Aquila (Despair), Galleon (Violent) (i would probably go with either Aquila for + crit%, or Galleon)
* another DD or support like (Lagmaron,) Ethna / Bernard for def breaks (+ speed)

Goal would be here, to make Lushens &amp; Teshar able to 1-shot the waves to save time. Aquila serves well here, because he would buff the ATK + crit% and they would need around ~70% ofc. Also his built-in violent should serve for frequent buffs and giant cleanse if necessary.

If using Teshar as leader, one would *need* an ATK buffer imo, otherwise 1-shotting the waves would be hard to achieve. But in general, i think Teshar + 2x Lushen should be enough as damage dealers, then maybe Bernard as support and Aquila for more damage or Chasun also for some heals",false,false,t1_ctwa27x,suriel-,Don't feed the Monkey !,0,1439071744,t5_324pd,t3_3g9sp9,t3_3g9sp9,0,1440363929,0,0,ctwa27x,summonerswar,0,,375

"That's the Endorser!  I really love it.  I carry it the most of the bunch.  It's just a really great looking knife all around, and it's small and non-imposing enough to not freak most people out, but large enough to still be practical for most things.

The downside of it is that it can only be opened right handed.  It has yet another one of CRKT's weird locking features built into the thumb stud.  The stud actually has a little button you have to press a bit to push the liner lock aside before you can open it.  It's a little annoying, but it's easy to get used to, and it actually is kind of a nice idea.  I like it a lot better than the safety on my Kershaw for example, which has that screw you have to slide all the way at the butt end of the handle.

I adore my Fossil, but I rarely carry it.  I just feel like most places I go currently wouldn't appreciate me whipping that big guy out.  The smaller models might be more acceptable though.  Also, I just don't want to use it that heavily, because it looks so nice, haha.

The flipping action is really smooth for a bade that big thanks to the ball bearings, but I wish the flipper itself was a bit larger.  I find it hard to get enough leverage sometimes to open it in one motion.  Also, it wasn't long after I got it that I had to oil it a bit.  After flipping it open for a few hours, the action became pretty stiff.  After I oiled it however, it's been fine ever since.

The biggest flaw the Fossil has is its pocket clip.  It does look cool, and it does keep the knife in place just fine, but like many people have said, it's WAY too easy to get caught on something and bend the shit out of.  Mine got caught on my car door one night.  It was bent badly enough that it wasn't gonna clip anymore, but it wasn't bad enough that I couldn't bend it back into place by removing one of the screws holding it to the handle, rotating it out, and applying a decent amount of opposing pressure until it clipped tightly enough again. 

Edit: Also, be careful when closing the Fossil.  It closes really easily once you move the frame lock, and my Fossil chewed up a couple of my fingers really good before I took proper care while closing it.

"Yet we will ever more find out why the universe is a comprehensible place, weeding out all of the reasons why an incomprehensible place could not exist. 

Gravity seemed this sort of comprehensibly poetic when it was merely a function of distance squared. ""Perfect math out of a universe that could just as easily been incomprehensible? That infers a creator!""

Then we got relativity which worked to remove the comprehensibility from nothing. ""Oh, well our five variable equation explanation is gone, but there's still this beautiful spacetime architecture."" Now we have the higgs field and on and on.

Is there an end? No idea.

Is it sound theory to just keep pushing back every level of comprehensibility with a God of the gaps? No.
 
This watchmakers variant is devious because it is pushed all the way back to the final variable of comprehensibility, but it suffers from the same flaws.

"&gt;Have you had a customer prefer purchasing from Dell, HP or Lenovo instead of an unknown name (even if it has your company name on it) because of perceived quality or warranty?

No. Here's how this works. Take any computer ""manufacturer"" (Dell, HP, ASUS, Off-brands, anyone). All the hardware comes from the same places. All motherboards are built in China and typically by Foxconn or a Foxconn-company. All add-in cards (NICs, Video Adatpers, Sound cards, etc.) are built in China by Foxconn.

Hard Drives all come from a few manufacturers - Seagate, Maxtor, WD, a couple others.

CPUs all come from either Intel or AMD.

So as you can see, regardless of the builder of the computer, all the hardware really comes from just a few sources. The only difference between brands is that the big guys will design their own motherboard and chassis. But then, the motherboards are all manufactured by the same Chinese manufacturer (Foxconn). 

So once I explain that to the customer, I'm more easily able to explain to them the truth: Quality of one brand over another, is a false perception. *You* like HP because you've had good success with them in the past. I can find just as many people who, due to past problems, will never by HP again. 

All this reinforces my position. By not buying from the big names, I'm not forcing my customer into that company's options. I get to pick the specific make/model of hard drive. You can't do that with Dell or HP. I get to pick the specific make/model of motherboard. You can't do that with Dell or HP. I get to pick the specific make/model of the pieces that are going into the computer. You can't do that with the other guys. That means, I get to look at a large number of options and really spec it out in detail for the customer and get what *I* want, not what someone else wants me to have. Customers love that.

 &gt;Speaking of warranty, I know the Latitudes we used to order at a previous job were ordered with next business day parts or replacement. How does Equus handle that aspect?

Equus has NBD as well, but as I recall, there's an extra charge (it's been a while since I had to do warranty support on one of their machines). 

Equus even has a program you can sign up for, where they'll pay you for doing the warranty work - even on the machine you sold to your customer. So I sell the machine to the customer. Customer is paying me a monthly service contract for all support on the computer. Then, when the problem is a hardware issue, I call up Equus and work with them for a little bit to review my troubleshooting and confirm it's a hardware problem. Equus overnights the part and I replace it. And for all this, Equus pays me something like $75 for being the on-site tech (This helps off-set the cost of shipping the parts if there is one for overnight.)!

Side Note: Warranty is actually covered by Nebilus (something like that), which is the sister company to Equus.",false,false,t1_cuatbaj,Beauregard_Jones,,0,1440174859,t5_2slwq,t3_3hr8vm,t1_cuasfrg,0,1441387017,0,0,cuatbaj,msp,0,,

Violation:

## [Rule 5: Asking for medical or injury advice is not allowed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_5._asking_for_medical_or_injury_advice_is_not_allowed)

&gt;If you're sick, hurt, or injured you should be getting help and/or advice somewhere else - preferably from a doctor. While people in Fittit might have similar conditions as you, not a single person will be able to examine you personally or understand your specific situation, and it's very hard to validate credentials over the internet. You should instead find a professional with proper schooling and experience who can examine and treat you in person. General Practitioners might not be the best for sports-related issues, so it is recommended that you find a Sports Medicine doctor or a Physical Therapist.

&gt;Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: training advice with a known medical condition; training advice specifically involving an injured body part; and ""general experience"" posts asking about other people's experiences with a particular injury.  Posts on these topics are considered requests for medical/injury advice and are not allowed.  Posts seeking training advice that *excludes* an injured body part are allowed.

&gt;If you would like help identifying or correcting a painful movement, consider posting a [form check]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_2._how_to_post_a_form_check).  
*If you post a form check and there's something wrong with your form; /r/Fitness can help with that. If your form is perfect, there's something wrong with your body and you need to see a doctor*    

&gt;Wondering if you hurt yourself or just experiencing normal soreness? See [this FAQ entry](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_did_i_hurt_myself_or_is_this_normal_soreness.3F).
If you want generic ""injury"" advice, please read the [FAQ entry](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_did_i_hurt_myself_or_is_this_normal_soreness.3F) on it.

"**Exercise:**
Most doctors recommend an hour of exercise daily for 5-6 days a week to support cardiovascular and muscular health. You should do whatever type of exercise makes you sweat and you enjoy. Check out the [Fitness Q&amp;A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/faq#wiki_exercise_details) for more guidance


**Exercise and Weight Loss:**

Exercise and weight loss are not unrelated, but exercise will not lead to weight loss without significant changes to what you eat. Eat less to lose weight. 


**Cheap/healthy snacks:**
What's cheap depends where you live. Lots of snacks are low calorie and filling: fruit, yogurt, cheese, milk, and veggies+hummus are some of my favorites. 


**Pasta/rice:**

"For future refernce, when a girl hides the fact that she is dating from an ex, it is a warning sign that she's either:

a) still f*cking him,

b) holding out hope that they can get back together,

or in your case,
c) both

This girl is obviously not the girl you should marry, or even talk to anymore. You need to cut her out of your life. This is reallllly reminiscent of a previous relationship of mine. The good times are so good that you are completely blinded to all the lies. 

Cut her out completely and move on. You won't see it until you can objectively look at the situation as a whole from outside of it that a person who will repeatedly lie to your face is NOT a good person. You will also be like ""damn, I was an idiot."" You don't need that in your life dude.

You totally know me and what I argue for. Again, you're just creating a strawman to attack, and this isn't even a good one because it in itself is another fallacy.

&gt;The cool thing about rights is you don't have to justify them to people on the internet. So deal with it.

Except don't forget that I can vote. And I will vote for politicians that want more strict gun laws.

&gt;Also regardless of your defeatist attitude, guerrilla tactics do indeed win wars. Despite losing battles. 

They win wars sometimes when they have external support. When they don't have external support, well, they don't stand a chance. We've seen that replayed a hundred times. Guerrillas loose far more often than they win. In the United States though? Get real. If you started a rebellion, they'd take you out before you could sneeze. In fact, it likely wouldn't even need to involve the army - the FBI alone is large enough and militarized enough to do it.

&gt;And you're on crack if you think the US military will wage a full scale war on its citizenry.

Considering you'd just rebelled against the United States, most of them would. The ones that wouldn't, that are on your extremest, absurd side would be quickly subdued by the rest. In fact, it's already happened before - in the first civil war. Our military already has a historical record of doing whatever is needed to defeat a rebellion. No matter what you did, that's what it would be framed as. They have the money, the men, the media control and the resources to frame whatever you try to do as extremist nuts being crazy and they've had to deploy some men to take care of it. The internet?

I still like Lewis a lot. He has great chemistry with Simon, of course but also with Sips and Sjin. I enjoy the /r/ShitLewisSays incredibly. And the faces he pulls on the livestreams are the best. Seriously, look at [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POf_Nh0zqPI). Not to mention the speech for Datlof and the ""moonquest breakdown"". Classic moments.  

I like Kim a lot as a person but I'm not much into most of the games she plays. Or at least not into watching them. 

I also always enjoy Sjin's content, especially when he's working with Sips or Lewis (and Duncan). And Sjin plays a lot of minecraft which is honestly still my favourite kind of content.

And then of course there is Sips who, imo, makes the best solo content out of everyone and is always a joy to watch.

It's difficult to pick a favourite because every Yogscast member has their own style and it depends a bit on my mood which one I prefer on any given day.

"I tend not to accept the idea that religious punishments (or rewards) are really infinite. Going to Hell seems really bad, but not *infinitely* bad. But how exactly one would make this distinction meaningful, anyway? Well, I think the finitude of rewards and punishments is less important than the other thing you brought up:

&gt; critically that you don't have other religions dishing out infinite rewards even in cases where you don't believe in them, or punishments even when you do

In general, I expect that this should happen. More precisely, I expect that whatever really terrible thing happens to an atheist in the original Pascal's wager (finite or infinite) would also happen to a Christian in an extended Pascal's wager where the choices are Islam, Christianity, and atheism, and Islam turns out to be correct. In that scenario, there is no clear way to decide between Islam and Christianity, although atheism is clearly the worst of the three. Atheism looks better once you add as a possible god a god who doesn't want to be believed in. And to make Pascal's wager realistic, you need to include not only one form of Christianity, one form of Islam, and an anti-theistic god, but lots and lots of other possibilities as well.

&gt; I guess the issue with this for me is that I have trouble think of philosophical questions which have been ""answered"" by non-scientific or mathematical means.

Well, for example, a possible religious answer to the question of free will is that there is no free will but God's, which controls the entire universe from atom to atom.

"In my experience, you generally bake that into the form- but I'm no expert on the subject. I do two shows that are pretty heavy on narrative- USS Improvise (Star Trek inspired) and Hellfire Club (inspired by the play ""No Exit""). 

In both cases, we rely on the form to handle any narrative details, and in no case do those narrative details actually *matter*- in USS Improvise, whatever mission the ship is on is entirely irrelevant, it's just there as a foundation for funny scenes about ""regular joe"" characters. In Hellfire, our goal is to avoid arcs or progression in the characters- since they're in Hell and can never actually change.

For USS Improvise, our form is ""Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch"", which is really just an editing technique to cut from one thread to another- we basically ping-pong back and forth between two ongoing scenes. Any time anything starts getting ""plotty"", we cut to the other scene. Hellfire is an extremely long monoscene with *all* the performers on stage *all* the time.

"I think a normal, healthy interaction wouldn't get to that point in the first place - or hope it wouldn't, at least.

I see several comments here from people for whom tickling clearly brought up a lot of bad, bad memories and associations, and I'm not surprised. It can be insanely traumatic and for many children, it's one of the first times they feel physically violated - you're touching me and I don't want you to. Long before kids have any awareness of sex or intimacy, they know that being tickled longer than they want is AWFUL, and a good part of it is because yeah, they're being taught that they don't have control over their body or who touches them, and that's a really risky precedent to set. In some ways, it can even be child grooming, if the person is doing it intentionally just to erode the child's sense of bodily autonomy.

"&gt;Subtly trying to change your personal definitions of words when pressed to provide evidence for claims you make is called goal-post shifting.

I feel like I'd need to have made a claim prior to this for that to happen.  Your comment is in response to the only other comment of mine in this thread, I'm not sure what before-and-after goalposts you're seeing.

My stance is only that the financial cost of these speakers can't be removed from the examination of why speakers are disinvited just for the sake of highlighting ideological differences.  Most of the time, it's the biggest factor in deciding who gets an invitation in the first place, and that decision is made by elected representatives of the student body in most universities.  These speaker fees are usually a huge amount of money, with a huge opportunity cost.  If the speaker is announced and it becomes clear that students aren't interested in attending, then that cost isn't justified and the disinvitation is the most rational move for the university.  And sure, ideology is probably why a student body wouldn't be interested, and it's probably the only tangible reason a university could cite when the speaker asks why the student body wasn't interested.  But excluding cost from the story gives a biased and incomplete story of how these decisions are actually made.

"You make some good points and I would like to address them later but I am at work and popping in and out on mobile, so can't make my counterpoints at the moment but I will do so when I get home.

On the self defense side of it, I spent ten years in the military. Familiarity with guns is part of the package. But I was also a recruiter in a bad part of New Jersey. The feeling of helplessness against violent intent is hard to shake.

Have I ever had to protect myself with my firearms? No. and I'm glad I haven't. But the other side of that is I know people have them. And if they were banned, criminals wouldn't line up to turn them in. I wouldn't want to go to a gunfight with only my fists. Like I said, we can't un ring that bell.
I used to live in a less nice neighborhood. The lady downstairs smoked marijuana every day and the smoke would drift in through my ventilation. The apartments next door had dog fights in the parking lot about once a month, where the cops wouldn't arrest anyone. They'd just drive with lights and sirens and the people would scatter long before the cops arrived. The couple next door got broken into twice because their place used to be where a dealer lived.

Glad I moved to a nicer place. But I still keep my guns available.
my firearms are in a safe in my bedroom. I keep one firearm in a bedside safe, loaded, flashlight attached, and ready to fire.

The argument is often why should I keep my guns locked up at home? I don't have children, and everyone who lives in my home is educated and well-practiced with firearms. It comes down to personal preference and the cautious habits of a decade in the military.

I believe if people were educated and trained to use guns, and people were allowed to carry, then criminals would think twice about attacking innocents.

"First of all, I'm not trying to stop anyone from anything. You put your music out on a public forum and then got your feelings hurt when the reaction was negative. That's just silly and juvenile. 

Secondly, it appears that you're trying to use those age stats to prove that my quip was false by way of pointing out that your fanbase is largely 18-24. Well, that's assuming that 1) people in that age group are not still living at home with their parents, or at he very least still being assisted by their parents (especially those on said drugs which make your music tolerable) which everyone knows is just silly if you look at socioeconomic trends in the last 15 years. And B) That kids in college (or just out of college) don't do drugs as was my original implication. Yikes. 

Third... and this is purely speculation... what are you guys going to do when people forget about you? I'm asking this because when you DID upload your video to a major subreddit not soley based on the very niche market of music which you cater to, the reaction was mostly negative. Add on top of that the fleeting nature of popular music and the fact that while DeadMaus and Skillex are able to make a comfortable living (yes, I'm aware there are others) in ten years even they likely won't be raking in the same income they're currently enjoying now. Now, I'm no EDM fanatic, but seeing as this is the first time I've heard of you guys, I doubt you have the same draw or financial security they do.

"&gt; As a Giants fan it just gets exhausting hearing people instantly say ""Bumgarner is overrated"" every time he gets brought up.

My response to this is that as a Dodgers fan (and more generally a baseball fan) it get's exhausting hearing/reading people say Bumgarner is one of the best ever, or on track for the HoF, or even in the conversation for best pitcher in baseball right now. I can only speak for myself, but I avoid calling him overrated unless someone prompts it by making a claim like the ones above.

&gt; If we've already seen his peak, then of course he isn't a hall of famer. I just don't think we've seen his peak. He has gotten better every season. This is the best year of his career and it's a season in which everyone thought he would have a down year because of the workload of 2014. Everything he is doing is trending in the right direction and his path to 300 wins is better than anyone not named Kershaw.

This is pretty speculative, to basically assume he's likely to improve going forward. I would also argue that his 2015 is pretty much right in line with his 2014 and 2013 numbers in the aggregate. Nitpick, but most people would probably say Felix has a more clear path to 300 wins than Bumgarner (he's got 140 and is 29 right now).

&gt; His resume as a 26 year old is extremely impressive

Frankly, aside from the postseason, I have to disagree. Again, it gets back to the context of what's been done in baseball before. As a short hand, look at career bWAR through a pitcher's age-26 season. Bumgarner currently has 18.9, lets say he's nails down the stretch and finishes at an even 20. The record is **71.4** by Walter Johnson. There are 4 guys with over 40 then another 19 guys with 30+ (including Kershaw at 39.7 and Felix at 33.4).

"&gt; which we know doesn't impact violence in any way

We're talking about banning the weapons that were used in several mass-shootings in the last decade, right? (Not trying to be sarcastic, I haven't paid attention to all the details here.)  I realize that mass shootings are a small fraction of gun murders, but reducing the number of casualties from mass shootings isn't doing nothing. Schools, stadiums, and other places have spent millions on improving security as a result of these shootings.  While I don't think it is a totally rational fear, it isn't a dishonest one.

Some of the gun control proposals involve limiting the number of bullets that can be fired without reloading. Several shootings and attempted shootings were stopped when the gunman had to reload or when the gun jammed and the gunner had to take a second to switch to a different weapon.

Gun control advocates are also pushing to make sure everyone has to have a background check before they can get a gun.

Finally, nearly everyone who advocates for substantially restrictive gun control also supported expanding access to mental health care in the the Affordable Care Act.

A good example of this is apple watches don't support 3rd party watch faces(yes you can hack it). My point is simply that apple is proprietary when it comes to their products and IMO stubborn. Simply put, apple doesn't make it easy for developers to get their product to market. Android has its difficulties as well, but far less then apple. 

Edit: Another good example of apple making it hard for developers is it costs money to use their SDK, where as androids SDK is free. Just one of the many quirks I have about iOS and apple. I do front end webdev so don't do much with either so take my comments with as much grains of salt as you'd like.",false,false,t1_cumfcp1,nghbrh00d,,0,1441064307,t5_2qgzt,t3_3j3kla,t1_cumctwv,1,1441616342,0,0,cumfcp1,gadgets,1,,

Considering the term -athlon means ""contest"" in Greek, why they have biathlon? And biathle don't make sense.

Also, ""duo-"", ""tri-"", ""tetra-"" and ""penta-"" in Greek are cardinal, meaning ""three"", ""four"" and ""five"".

"Jesus, que sockpuppet. Um Jotinha no seu melhor.

Não tenho nada contra a atitude de que ""para a frente é que é caminho"", e que realmente inovar e lutar por um país melhor é fundamental. Mas odeio quando esta malta aparece na TV a falar do ""bater punho"" e a atingir o clímax sempre que se fala em empreendedorismo. Será que esta gente não compreende que aqueles que não são empreendedores também têm direito a um salário digno do seu trabalho?

Tanta boa gente que conheço (amigos/família) se foi embora deste país por se encontrar num beco sem saída. Eestudantes com o curso superior sem oportunidades ou gente de todo e qualquer tipo de ofício e idade a ir-se embora, porque a dada altura deixa de ser possível viver com um salário pouco acima do mínimo. Quando se associa a ausência de empreendedorismo aos fenómenos de emigração, estamos a calcar todas estas pessoas, jovens ou não. Odeio quando esta gente vem à TV ser condescendente com aqueles que tiveram de (e tantas vezes, de alma destroçada) abandonar o país e os seus por não terem mais por onde ir. Filhos, pais, amigos para trás.

Há algum mal em um estudante querer acabar o seu curso e desejar apenas um trabalho regular na sua área? Será incompreensível que um enfermeiro que se forme em Portugal opte por trabalhar na Noruega, onde vai ganhar o triplo, empregado por um estado que tem a decência de atribuir a um profissional de saúde turnos que não são sobrehumanos? Sim, é errado pensar que curso=emprego, e que devemos esperar que as coisas no caiam do céu. Mas esta corrente do ""bater punho"" parece-me sempre mais uma forma de transferir a culpa de uma geração que gerou uma herança de cáca para uma nova que conhece a sua emancipação precisamente quando a cáca rebenta. 

Este lambe botas apelida aqueles que (foram forçados a) desistir, de desistentes. Logo a seguir sublinha as qualidades que atribuem aos trabalhadores portugueses lá fora. Não haverá alguma descrepância aqui? Desistentes/bons trabalhadores? What gives? Há muito português não-empreendedor pelo mundo fora a sustentar as suas famílias. Nem todos precisaram de ser empreendedores, só precisaram de ser trabalhadores. Em Portugal, nem com as grandes opurtunidades postas na mesa pelos nossos sucessivos muy nobres governos conseguiram segurar-se. São uns desistentes.

Já para não falar de que esta malta fala sempre nas pessoas que estão sentadas a mandar vir com o governo e que estão à espera. Pergunto-me, em boa verdade, qual será mais frequente: um jovem desempregado virar o seu descontentamento contra o governo, ou contra si mesmo. Podem não ser a maioria, mas quantos jovens portugueses não estarão neste momento a projectar em si as deficiências de uma economia que não tem lugar para eles. Quantos ""eu não sou bom o suficiente"" existirão para cada ""este governo está-me a foder a vida!"", ou quantos ""sou um fardo para os meus pais/avós/whatever"" existirão para cada ""quero que um emprego me caia do céu"". Consigo ver os empreendedores do séc. XXI a perscrever sessões de terapia aos nossos jovens desempregado. 1ª sessão: ""És um desistente.""

Estou farto desta retórica de merda que não serve em nada as pessoas que estão em situações precárias. Merda para estes políticos e os seus jotas ansiosos por lhes segurar as bolas. Merda para esta gente que desconhece qualquer tipo de empatia. Não querer ser um empreendedor xpto não quer dizer não querer contribuir para a sociedade. Querer justiça não é retórica de esquerda. Chama-se só querer viver em paz, sem ter de sentir a ansiedade quando chega a conta da água. É querer só viver num meio que respeite a vontade do cidadão de construir uma vida normal e segura. Ou então somos só uns desistentes do cacete. Podem encher a cabeça do pessoal com os bichinhos que quiserem, mas deixem-nos a distribuir as vossas canetas na rua, não os metam na TV.

"I had a conversation about this on facebook (yeah I know) the other day. Someone posted some article about how fear is a sin because the Bible says ""do not worry"" and I commented that that was kind of a dangerous attitude to take because it really alienates those with mental illnesses, a lot of which cause the sufferer a lot of fear. Saying ""fear is a sin"" surely wouldn't encourage those who can't *help* being scared to feel at home in the church. 

Of course, I got a comment reply that said that fear is a solely spiritual problem and if you suffer from excess fear you should pray and work it out with your pastor, it is not medical but spiritual. That comment was hailed as ""wisdom"". 

I grew up thinking my church was *totally* modern and progressive because it had all the best bands, was part of the best Christian festivals in the country etc. Then I got sick with a panic disorder and they sent the pastor round to exorcise me. That was nearly a whole decade ago, I faded out of the church and I still get panic attacks when I go to any church service. I don't dare tell any of my friends I had at the church why I left, that I am sick, because I know the fact that I am sick is to them a sign of spiritual weakness. I know not all churches think like this but, my church was not what you'd think of when you think ""backwards"". They were modern in every way...except when it comes to mental illness.

"Hey guys. 

We’re grateful for the feedback and while it's hard to hear that V6 hasn't worked to your expectations so far, it's thanks to feedback like this that will bring the improved release that's set to launch very soon, and we greatly appreciate it. Here, we'll try our best to respond to the main points in this thread.    

Regarding updating the client, many times the issue is localized at the client level.  Since you are encountering the issue on clients using Version 6 applications, we recommend that you examine the log files located at` C:\ProgramData\ESET\RemoteAdministrator\Agent\EraAgentApplicationData\Logs` to learn more about what is causing this issue.    

The trace log available in this path should indicate whether there are issues keeping the machine from reaching Update Servers, a lack of connectivity, or other issues present. It is possible that your Policy is telling the client to use the *Apache Http Proxy* rather than downloading updates from ESET servers. To validate this, go to the *Administrator Toolbox → Policies*. If you are not utilizing the *Apache HTTP Proxy,* locate any policies referencing ""*HTTP Proxy Usage*"" and remove them from the group ""*All*"".  This should alleviate issues with resolution to the Update servers by removing any references to the *Apache HTTP Proxy Server* if one is not in use.

To address the other pain points mentioned, many of these issues such as the naming of the clients in the console, threats showing on the client reporting screen, installation of the console and post installation tasks have been updated in **ESET Remote Administrator** 6.2, which is slated to release very soon. This version features an updated interface with improved functionality with integrated Task Wizards and support content built into the *ESET Web Console*. Version 6.2 also offers major improvements license management and tools for MSPs (Managed Service Providers) designed to provide a smooth transition to this new product from Version 5 and eliminate the need for the EMU applications used with previous versions of MSP.    

Regarding the **ESET Remote Administrator** 5.*x*/6.*x* search filtering on the knowledgebase: Thanks for pointing it out, our Knowledgebase team is working on that now and we expect to have the issue resolved within the next few days.",false,false,t1_cumfj2t,_ESET_,,0,1441064605,t5_2qnp7,t3_3ipy7i,t3_3ipy7i,2,1441616425,0,0,cumfj2t,sysadmin,2,,

"During the most tense part of the Cuban Missile Crisis blockade, some cowboy commander in a US Navy ship thought it would be a good idea to drop practice depth charges on a Russian sub it had detected to force it to surface.

Down in the Russian sub B-59, they had been out of contact with Moscow for several days, and had no way of knowing if war had already broken out. So the Captain gave the only logical order he could: sink the fucker. He ordered the launch of a nuclear-tipped torpedo. If that torpedo had been launched, none of us would be here today, the world be be a radioactive wasteland.

Fortunately for all of us, it took agreement of the boat's top three officers to use a nuke, and while the Captain and Political Officer were all for it, First Officer Vasili Arkhipov disagreed, and stood his ground even after being threatened with the loss of his career and/or shooting. Arkhipov literally saved the world single-handedly that day, and barely one person in a million knows his name.

I was at a very nice new restaurant with a group of women for dinner. It was on a slow night and we were seated in view of the bar. As the server walked around our table serving wine, the tray slipped and a wine glass fell off and smashed on my back. The server told me not to move and she ran off to get whatever but I sat there for what seemed like forever with my shoulders hunched afraid to move waiting for her to return. Finally my friends started picking glass off my back and shoulders and the server finally returned with a dust pan.

The whole time this was going on there were other servers hanging out around the bar within view of us- none of them made a move to help. I was not comped a glass of wine or anything else for the trouble of leaving the restaurant with glass shards in my clothes.

"&gt;Just learned about the Keto diet today.

Have you used the calulator on the sidebar to figure out your macros yet? http://keto-calculator.ankerl.com/

&gt;am wondering if anyone has made or known about a list of meals that I can make to help me in the Keto Diet

Did you see the meal plan in the sidebar? 

&gt;Unfortunately, I am not an experienced cook but am willing to learn.

I totally understand, that was once me. Most of the food commercially prepared is loaded with preservatives, sugar and unhealthy fats (like omega-6 polyunsaturated fats). Not to mention that the same thing made at home, even if decadent, is still usually fewer calories.

Think of learning to cook a bit for yourself as a long term investment in your own health (and potentially that of a future family).

Follow recipes at first until you learn to improvise:

1. https://www.reddit.com/r/ketorecipes
2. http://www.ruled.me/keto-recipes/

A great way to start is making bacon and then try cooking different veggie/egg/cheese mixes in the bacon grease (save some of the excess in a mug in the fridge).

In addition to meat, eggs, cheese, etc I eat nearly unrestricted amounts of things like cabbage, cauliflower, radishes (great cooked btw), brussel sprouts, spinach, green onions, broccoli, kohlrabi, lettuce, avocado, sprouts, green beans, rutabaga, leeks, yellow squash, zucchini, mushrooms, herbs.",false,false,t1_cu7wlva,v0idl0gic,"M/30/6'0"" | SW: 217 | CW: 162 | GW: 12% BF",0,1439957224,t5_2rske,t3_3hjepw,t3_3hjepw,1,1441336794,0,0,cu7wlva,keto,1,,

"As others here have said, Dwarven metal is an alloy of various minerals, but what hasn't been brought up is why it can't be recreated, only reused. 

All Dwemer technology owes some aspect of its continued functionality to Tonal Architecture, their particular exploitation of Aurbical tonality. It is not so much engineering as it is sheer rule-breaking. Dwarven metal hasn't rusted over the millennia because the Dwemer simply canceled the process of oxidation, as well as any other law of nature (weathering, corrosion) that could conceivably break it, weapons and tools notwithstanding - Tonal Architecture isn't powerful enough to overcome directed violence. Not without a divine energy source, anyway, but that's Numidium.

"&gt;I tried ""dice flicking"" but it stings the fingers and it's not very satisfying.

Instead of flicking the dice, push them as in the game of marbles. [Like here](http://www.americanmarbles.org/logo.gif) (sorry, this is the best picture I can find of the technique). Basically, you push/flick the die with your index finger. RPG dice would work great for that. This should make it less stingy to the fingers.

"The pieces don't make much sense to me.  On one hand, I think there's definitely this punk feminist chic that this could potentially be a play on.  From the Van Dykes to that girl from your college who does roller derby, cuts her own hair, and doesn't shave her armpits.  There is, in my opinion, this aesthetic that says ""I'm a feminist"" just as much as those scarves and shirts.  So, I guess, it could be a play on that.  

But that doesn't make much sense to me.  Toying with that identity in such a blatant way as Acne has here seems more like mockery than Vivienne Westwood.  So I don't really think that's it.

"I agree with what you're saying. But for young children, the books they're reading are not going to be particularly stimulating. 

And even in Call of Duty, you're still making decisions and choosing who to shoot. It's not much, but it's more independent thought than you'll find reading most child appropriate fiction. 

Some people will be different, and I'm sure there are 6 year olds who can beat Dark Souls with their eyes closed while considering the philosophy of Proust. 

But that isn't most kids. 

Games and especially Video Games are some of the absolute best tools for teaching children. They learn to problem solve, they learn to think rigorously, they learn fair play, and they can enjoy the games with friends. 

Books are much better than games for showing them the world from perspectives that ate not their own. They build vocabulary and they can greatly improve a child's curiosity and will to learn. But if you want them to learn quick-fire, snap decision making and strategy, games are where it's at, if it's playing monopoly or burnout.

"Hey! Well.. here is the preemptive congratulations, and welcome! 

It's all what you want out of the car. If it's a daily driver, I would want something with more room and comfort-ability. With that being said, I own an A4 and I drive aprox. 50 miles to work, and 50 miles back - so 100 round trip. And in the car, stop n go traffic about 1 hour .. to 1 and a half hours. So gas-consumption is key for me, I can't be filling up every time I want to go to work.

Gas costs me around 130/week. With the a6 (I can only assume) you wouldn't be tempted to race / drive spiritedly all the time, since it isn't a sport sedan. Although with the s4, since you know you have 330+ horses behind you, you might be tempted to depress that accelerator a little more. On the weekends, though, the s4 would definitely be prime! 

For routine maintenance, the s4 would be a little more expensive since it is a performance vehicle, so brakes, suspension, and the whole she-bang would be a little more than the A6. 

What I'm trying to say is that; What matters the most for you? The during the week mundane grind to work, with fun on the weekends? Or... THE WEEKENDS! where you can truely show that bad boy off? 

I'd go with the S4, TBH IMO. But then again, I've never owned an A6.

"For a serious answer, I recently went to a game for the first time in a few years this past season, and I got autographs from every Twolf that played except for Adrien Payne. 

1. Get there early. Like be there before they even let you in and be the first in line. Some places this is 2 hours before tip off. Other places this is 1hr 30 mins. I think in Boston it's just an hour. Anyways, get there early and bring a sharpie if you can, though some security may not allow it. Also, bring whatever you want signed. Posters, plaques, jerseys, pendants, etc.

2. Try to make sure that you purchase a ticket by the tunnel. I'm a Twolves fan but I live in SoCal. I picked a ticket by the visitors tunnel/bench and was right by all the players. If you're a Cleveland fan that lives in Cleveland, I assume it will be harder to get autographs. The more popular the team  or players, the harder it will be to get an autograph. When I went it was the end of the season and Wolves were the worst WCF team and the Lakers were the 2nd worst. Take that into consideration. 

3. Don't be afraid to call out the names of players as they walk BACK into the locker room. When they run out on the court for warm ups, they are unlikely to sign. When they come BACK from warm ups is when they usually sign. After that, it's basically game over. You can try half time or after the game, but don't count on it. The only way that that would possibly work is if they are injured and in a suit but even then players aren't really in the mood to sign if they aren't playing.

4. It doesn't hurt to wear the jersey or logo of the team you want autographs from.
